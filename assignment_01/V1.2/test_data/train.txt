Anatomy

Anatomy (Greek anatomē, “dissection”) is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.  Anatomy is a branch of natural science dealing with the structural organization of living things.  It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.  Anatomy is inherently tied to embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny, as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales.  Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine.

The discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy.  Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight.  Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy.  Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.

The history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body.  Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.

Anatomy and physiology, which study (respectively) the structure and function of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair of related disciplines, and they are often studied together.

Derived from the Greek ἀνατομή "anatomē" "dissection" (from ἀνατέμνω "anatémnō" "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά "aná" "up", and τέμνω "témnō" "I cut"), anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems, organs and tissues.  It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts.  Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved.  For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile, the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions.

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy.  Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features.  Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).

Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems.  Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures.  Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.

The term "anatomy" is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy.  However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals.  The term "zootomy" is also sometimes used to specifically refer to animals.  The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy.

The kingdom Animalia or metazoa, contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle).  Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans.  They have an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development.  Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have undifferentiated cells.

Unlike plant cells, animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell.  The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell, including those found in muscles, nerves and skin.  Each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids, cytoplasm and a nucleus.  All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic.  All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.

Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: connective, epithelial, muscle and nervous tissue.

Connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix.  Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place.  The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone.  The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen.  Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues.  The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body.  An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects.  An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.

Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space.  Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells.  There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function.  In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi.  Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body.  Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin.  The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle.  In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins.  In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.

Muscle cells (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body.  Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs.  Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle.  Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically.  It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths.  It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension.  It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws.  Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two.  The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.  In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets.  Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

Nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information.  In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles.  In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus.  In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism.  Neurons can be connected together in ganglia.  In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system.  The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs.  The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.

All vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus.  The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it.  Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm.  At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut.  The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail.  The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae.  In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood.  Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost.  The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor.  This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.

The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible.  The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish.  The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong.  The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles.  The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine.  They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.  The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.  The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision.  There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear.  Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.

Sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage.  Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head.  The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales.  They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder.  Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs.  Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.

The bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish.  They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout.  The dermis is covered with overlapping scales.  Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca.  They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.

Amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs, salamanders and caecilians.  They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size.  Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes.  Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae.  Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified.  Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands.  The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle.  They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea.  Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils.  These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.  They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs.  The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing.  Frogs have large eyes and no tail.  Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail.  Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless.  They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.

Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles.  They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size.  Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians.  The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size.  The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer.  Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls.  The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams.  The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species.  The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species.  The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.

Turtles are notable for their protective shells.  They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below.  These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine.  The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell.  Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates.  In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.

Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period.  There is one living species, "Sphenodon punctatus".  The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull.  There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews.  The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down.  The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi.  The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.

Lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost.  This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider.  Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes.  Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.

Snakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the Cretaceous period, and they share many of the same features.  The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs.  The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole.  Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent "spectacle" scales.  They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull.  Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.

Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth.  The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed.  It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming.  The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull.  The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating.  Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged.  Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

Birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight.  Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles.  The long bones are thin, hollow and very light.  Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones.  The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused.  There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak.  The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls.  They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.

The feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin.  Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds.  The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail.  This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens.  There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.

Mammals are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight.  They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings.  The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground.  The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel.  The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in cetaceans.  Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear.  They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat.  Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young.  Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs.  The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate.  Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.

Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young.  The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia.  Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.

Humans have the overall body plan of a mammal.  Humans have a head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), two arms and hands, and two legs and feet.

Generally, students of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers.  The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.

Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school.  Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems.  The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods.  A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.

Academic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals.  They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

Invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as "Paramecium" to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly.  They constitute about 95% of the animal species.  By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone.  The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs.  Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton.  Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.

Metazoans are multicellular organism, different groups of cells of which have separate functions.  The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates.  The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism.  An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters).  Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria.  Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids.  The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells.  There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.

Marcello Malpighi, the father of microscopical anatomy, discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm.  He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring.

Arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species.

Insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin.  The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen.  The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts.  The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings.  The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems.  There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.

Spiders a class of arachnids have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a cephalothorax and an abdomen.  Spiders have no wings and no antennae.  They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous.  They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax.  These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs.  At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ.

In 1600 BCE, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, an Ancient Egyptian medical text, described the heart, its vessels, liver, spleen, kidneys, hypothalamus, uterus and bladder, and showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart.  The Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE) features a "treatise on the heart", with vessels carrying all the body's fluids to or from every member of the body.

Ancient Greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world.  Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body.  Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and the nervous system.

The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology.  Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks, but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers.  Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemy rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.

Some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria.  Two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were Herophilus and Erasistratus.  These two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research.  They also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals, which was considered taboo until the Renaissance – Herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections.  Herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine.  Some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse, the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls then veins, and that the atria were parts of the heart.  Herophilus’s knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and nervous system, and characterizing the course of disease.  Erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain, including the cavities and membranes, and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum During his study in Alexandria, Erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems.  He was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body.  His distinction between the arteries and veins – the arteries carrying the air through the body, while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery.  Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart, including the tricuspid.  During the third century, Greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses.  It was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis.  Herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain, appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the "seat of intellect" and not a "cooling chamber" as propounded by Aristotle Herophilus is also credited with describing the optic, oculomotor, motor division of the trigeminal, facial, vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves.

Great feats were made during the third century in both the digestive and reproductive systems.  Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver.  He showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes.  He recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland.

The anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the "Hippocratic Corpus", an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors.  Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection.  Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins. Also in the 4th century BCE, Herophilos and Erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty.

In the 2nd century, Galen of Pergamum, an anatomist, clinician, writer and philosopher, wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times.  He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals.  He was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals.  Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years.  His work was known to Renaissance doctors only through Islamic Golden Age medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.

Anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century; as the historian Marie Boas writes, "Progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid".  Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists Mondino de Luzzi, Alessandro Achillini and Antonio Benivieni at Bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times.  Mondino's "Anatomy" of 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy.  It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, then the thorax, then the head and limbs.  It was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century.

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by Andrea del Verrocchio.  He made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.

Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), professor of anatomy at the University of Padua, is considered the founder of modern human anatomy.  Originally from Brabant, Vesalius published the influential book "De humani corporis fabrica" ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543.  The accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in allegorical poses against Italianate landscapes, are thought to have been made by the artist Jan van Calcar, a pupil of Titian.

In England, anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science; these were given by the Company of Barbers and Surgeons in the 16th century, joined in 1583 by the Lumleian lectures in surgery at the Royal College of Physicians.

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century.  Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain.  Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins.  A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers.  Some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers.  The practice was halted in Britain by the Anatomy Act of 1832, while in the United States, similar legislation was enacted after the physician William S. Forbes of Jefferson Medical College was found guilty in 1882 of "complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in Lebanon Cemetery".

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir John Struthers, Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen from 1863 to 1889.  He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy.  This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003.  As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy, published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the Tay Whale.  From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.  Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching.  Ignaz Semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused.  He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives.  The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth.  Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.

Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living.  It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues.  Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things.  Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine.  Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue.  Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens.  The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them.  About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.

Equally important advances have occurred in "non-invasive" techniques for examining the interior structures of the body.  X-rays can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness.  Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and ultrasound imaging have all enabled examination of internal structures, living or dead, in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.

Affirming the consequent

Affirming the consequent, sometimes called converse error, fallacy of the converse or confusion of necessity and sufficiency, is a formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement.  The corresponding argument has the general form:

An argument of this form is invalid, i.e., the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true.  Since "P" was never asserted as the "only" sufficient condition for "Q", other factors could account for "Q" (while "P" was false).

To put it differently, if "P" implies "Q", the only inference that can be made is "non-Q" implies "non-P".  ("Non-P" and "non-Q" designate the opposite propositions to "P" and "Q".)  This is known as logical contraposition.  Symbolically:

formula_2

The name "affirming the consequent" derives from the premise "Q", which affirms the "then" clause of the conditional premise.

Example 1

One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion.  For example:

Owning Fort Knox is not the "only" way to be rich.  Any number of other ways exist to be rich.

However, one can affirm with certainty that "if someone is not rich" ("non-Q"), then "this person does not own Fort Knox" ("non-P").  This is the contrapositive of the first statement, and it must be true if and only if the original statement is true.

Example 2

Arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example:

But having the flu is not the "only" cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat, such as the common cold or strep throat.

Affirming the consequent is commonly used in rationalization, and thus appears as a coping mechanism in some people.

Example 3

In "Catch-22", the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being 'Washinton Irving'/'Irving Washington', who has been blocking out large portions of soldier's letters home.  The colonel has found such a letter, but with the Chaplain's name signed.

"P" in this case is 'The chaplain signs his own name', and "Q" 'The chaplain's name is written'.  The chaplain's name may be written, but he did not necessarily write it, as the colonel falsely concludes "(and in fact he did not, as in the novel, Yossarian signed the name"")".

Ambiguity

Ambiguity is a type of uncertainty of meaning in which several interpretations are plausible.  It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps.  (The "ambi-" part of the term reflects an idea of "two", as in "two meanings".)

The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness.  In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.

Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity.  For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.

The lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs.  "Meaning" here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary.  For instance, the word "bank" has several distinct lexical definitions, including "financial institution" and "edge of a river".  Or consider "apothecary".  One could say "I bought herbs from the apothecary".  This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary (pharmacist) or went to the apothecary (pharmacy).

The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended.  If, for instance, someone says "I buried $100 in the bank", most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud.  However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.

Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as word sense disambiguation.

The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used).  The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed.  An exception to this could include a politician whose "weasel words" and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice.  Ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science.

More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts.  "Good", for example, can mean "useful" or "functional" ("That's a good hammer"), "exemplary" ("She's a good student"), "pleasing" ("This is good soup"), "moral" ("a good person" versus "the lesson to be learned from a story"), "righteous", etc. " I have a good daughter" is not clear about which sense is intended.  The various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity ("unlockable" can mean "capable of being unlocked" or "impossible to lock").

Syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax.  This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear.  "He ate the cookies on the couch", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.  "To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license."  This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license.  Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher.  Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.

For the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, formal languages (such as computer programming languages), see Ambiguous grammar.

Spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words.  For example, "ice cream" and "I scream".  Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context.  A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a mondegreen.

Semantic ambiguity happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase—a word or phrase that has more than one meaning.  In "We saw her duck" (example due to Richard Nordquist), the word "duck" can refer either

For example, "You could do with a new automobile.  How about a test drive?"  The clause "You could do with" presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless.  Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity.  The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations.  The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning.  This form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness.

Linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law, because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.

Philosophers (and other users of logic) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments.  For example, a politician might say, "I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth", an example of a glittering generality.  Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth.  Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth.  In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after "taxes" (to convey the first sense) or by changing "which" to "that" (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways.  The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion.  However, the opposite can also be true – an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not).  The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In continental philosophy (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition.  Martin Heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole. [3] In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification.  Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death.  In calling his work Being and Nothingness an "essay in phenomenological ontology" Jean-Paul Sartre follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity.  Simone de Beauvoir tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: "as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal.  It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment."  Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science.  She states: "Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face.  Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity.  It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting".  Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous.  Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate.  Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence have led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide.  On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty.  Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.

In literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool.  Groucho Marx's classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example: "Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas.  How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know".  Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" (where "blue" can refer to the color, or to sadness).

In narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character.  F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel "The Great Gatsby".

Christianity and Judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity'.  Many Christians and Jews endorse Rudolf Otto's description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans. [dubious – discuss] The orthodox Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous, or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases.  (The title of one of his most famous books, Orthodoxy, itself employing such a paradox.)

Metonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or jargon, for the name of the whole object (for example "wheels" to refer to a car, or "flowers" to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants).  In modern vocabulary critical semiotics,[9] metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as "sweet ride" to refer to a nice car.  Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humour.

In music, pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some polytonality, polymeter, other ambiguous meters or rhythms, and ambiguous phrasing, or (Stein 2005, p. 79) any aspect of music.  The music of Africa is often purposely ambiguous.  To quote Sir Donald Francis Tovey (1935, p. 195), "Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value."

In visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the Necker cube, which can be interpreted in two ways.  Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called multistable perception.

The opposite of such ambiguous images are impossible objects.

Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?

Some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially lexical ambiguity.  Lojban and Loglan are two related languages which have been created for this, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well.  The languages can be both spoken and written.  These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized.  Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency.  The many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.

In computer science, the SI prefixes kilo-, mega- and giga- were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 (1024, 1024 and 1024) contrary to the metric system in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion.  This usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices (e.g. DRAM) addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense.

Subsequently, the Ki, Mi, and Gi prefixes were introduced so that binary prefixes could be written explicitly, also rendering k, M, and G "unambiguous" in texts conforming to the new standard — this led to a "new" ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes (necessarily indicating the new style) as to whether the usage of k, M, and G remains ambiguous (old style) or not (new style).  Note also that 1 M (where M is ambiguously 1,000,000 or 1,048,576) is "less" uncertain than the engineering value 1.0e6 (defined to designate the interval 950,000 to 1,050,000), and that as non-volatile storage devices began to commonly exceed 1 GB in capacity (where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit), GB and TB almost always mean 10 and 10 bytes.

Mathematical notation, widely used in physics and other sciences, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language.  However, for various reasons, several lexical, syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain.

The ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function, which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way.  Several special functions still do not have established notations.  Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions.  Examples of such underestablished functions:

Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.

It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions.  Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, formula_1.  Then, if one sees formula_2, there is no way to distinguish whether it means formula_1 multiplied by formula_4, or function formula_5 evaluated at argument equal to formula_4.  In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.

Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities.  Many algorithmic languages (C++ and Fortran) require the character * as symbol of multiplication.  The Wolfram Language used in Mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions.  Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression f=f(x) is qualified as an error.

The order of operations may depend on the context.  In most programming languages, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right.  Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, formula_7 is interpreted as formula_8; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language.  In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.

Sometimes, one uses "italics" letters to denote elementary functions.

In the scientific journal style, the expression

formula_9

means

product of variables

formula_10,

formula_11,

formula_12 and

formula_13, although in a slideshow, it may mean formula_14.

A comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.

If it is written formula_15, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables

formula_16, formula_12 and formula_18, or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.

The writing of formula_15 instead of formula_20 may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers.  The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.

Subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in formula_21.

formula_22, which could be understood to mean either formula_23 or formula_24.  In addition, formula_25 may mean formula_26, as formula_27 means formula_28 (see tetration).

formula_29, which by convention means formula_30, though it might be thought to mean formula_31, since formula_32 means formula_33.

formula_34, which arguably should mean formula_35 but would commonly be understood to mean formula_36 .

It is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with formula_37 and states with fixed number of photons with formula_38.  Then, there is an "unwritten rule": the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and formula_39photon state if the Latin characters dominate.  The ambiguity becomes even worse, if formula_40 is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and formula_41 means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on quantum mechanics.  Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized adimensional, dimensionless variables are used.  Expression formula_42 may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on.  The reader is supposed to guess from the context.

Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even dimension, as in the case of the Einstein coefficients), depends on the system of notations.  Many terms are ambiguous.  Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case.  Just like Ludwig Wittgenstein states in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: "... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning."

A highly confusing term is "gain".  For example, the sentence "the gain of a system should be doubled", without context, means close to nothing.

It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.

It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.

It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).

The term "intensity" is ambiguous when applied to light.  The term can refer to any of irradiance, luminous intensity, radiant intensity, or radiance, depending on the background of the person using the term.

Also, confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant, or resolution of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise.  See also Accuracy and precision and its talk.

The Berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as "definable" or "nameable".  Terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies.  Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.

In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of underdetermination—for example, formula_43 leaves open what the value of "X" is—while its opposite is a self-contradiction, also called inconsistency, paradoxicalness, or oxymoron, or in mathematics an inconsistent system—such as formula_44, which has no solution.

Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible objects, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of M. C. Escher.

Aardvark

The aardvark ( ; "Orycteropus afer") is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa.  It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known.  Unlike other insectivores, it has a long pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food.  It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky.  A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs.  It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young.  It receives a "least concern" rating from the IUCN, although its numbers seem to be decreasing.

The aardvark is sometimes colloquially called "African ant bear", "anteater" (not to be confused with the South American anteater), or the "Cape anteater" after the Cape of Good Hope.  The name "aardvark" (] ) comes from earlier Afrikaans (erdvark) and means "earth pig" or "ground pig" ("aarde": earth/ground, "vark": pig), because of its burrowing habits (similar origin to the name groundhog).  The name "Orycteropus" means burrowing foot, and the name "afer" refers to Africa.  The name of the aardvarks's order, "Tubulidentata," comes from the tubule-style teeth.

The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order Tubulidentata, in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus "Orycteropus", the sole surviving genus in the family Orycteropodidae.  The aardvark is not closely related to the South American anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance.  The similarities are based on convergent evolution.  The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews, tenrecs and golden moles. Along with the sirenians, hyraxes, elephants, and their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder Afrotheria.  Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with Condylarthra, and given the clade's status as a wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as "condylarths" are actually stem-aardvarks.

Based on fossils, Bryan Patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in Africa around the end of the Paleocene.  The ptolemaiidans, a mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities, may actually be stem-aardvarks, either as a sister clade to Tubulidentata or as a grade leading to true tubulidentates.

The first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably "Myorycteropus africanus" from Kenyan Miocene deposits.  The earliest example from the "Orycteropus" genus was the "Orycteropus mauritanicus" found in Algeria in deposits from the middle Miocene, with an equally aged version found in Kenya.  Fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years, and have been located throughout Europe and the Near East.

The mysterious Pleistocene "Plesiorycteropus" from Madagascar was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the Eocene.  However, a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that "Plesiorycteropus" is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark-like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution.

The aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed:

The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica also mentions "O. a. capensis" or Cape ant-bear from South Africa.

The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance.  Its body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs.  The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs.  The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes.  Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof.  Whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade, it appears at time to be plantigrade.  This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles.

An aardvark's weight is typically between 60 and(-) .  An aardvark's length is usually between 105 and(-) , and can reach lengths of 2.2 m when its tail (which can be up to 70 cm ) is taken into account.  It is 60 cm tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about 100 cm .  It is the largest member of the proposed clade Afroinsectiphilia.  The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by soil.  The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin.  Its hair is short on its head and tail; however its legs tend to have longer hair.  The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 hairs.  The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs.  Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.

The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils.  It contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch.  The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features.  One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their teeth.  Instead of having a pulp cavity, each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of dentine), with individual pulp canals, held together by cementum.  The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500.  The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously.  The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced.  Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw, and have a dental formula of: 0.0.2-3.30.0.2.3 These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition.  The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars.  The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten nasal conchae, more than any other placental mammal.

The sides of the nostrils are thick with hair.  The tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified mimetic muscles.  The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions, but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature.  Its nose is made up of more turbinate bones than any other mammal, with between 9 and 11, compared to dogs with 4 to 5.  With a large quantity of turbinate bones, the aardvark has more space for the moist epithelium, which is the location of the olfactory bulb.  The nose contains nine olfactory bulbs, more than any other mammal.  Its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its olfactory lobe is very developed.  The snout resembles an elongated pig snout.  The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on ants and termites.  The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue (as much as 30 cm long) and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell.  The ears, which are very effective, are disproportionately long, about 20 - long.  The eyes are small for its head, and consist only of rods.

The aardvark's stomach has a muscular pyloric area that acts as a gizzard to grind swallowed food up, thereby rendering chewing unnecessary.  Its cecum is large.  Both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland.  Its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck; their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness.  The female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal region.

Genetically speaking, the aardvark is a living fossil, as its chromosomes are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa.

Aardvarks are found in sub-Saharan Africa, where suitable habitat (savannas, grasslands, woodlands and bushland) and food (i.e., ants and termites) is available.  They spend the daylight hours in dark underground burrows to avoid the heat of the day.  The only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest, as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth.  They also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging.  They have been documented as high as 3200 m in Ethiopia.  They are present throughout sub-Saharan Africa all the way to South Africa with few exceptions.  These exceptions include the coastal areas of Namibia, Ivory Coast, and Ghana.  They are not found in Madagascar.

Aardvarks live for up to 23 years in captivity.  Its keen hearing warns it of predators: lions, leopards, cheetahs, hunting dogs, hyenas, and pythons.  Some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat.  Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet.  They are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker.  They will also dig to escape as they can, when pressed, dig extremely quickly.  Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.

The aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites (formivore); the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber.  In fact, the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit, then defecate the seeds near their burrows, which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area.  The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark.  They avoid eating the African driver ant and red ants.  Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large range to survive.  An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 to .  While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food.  They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5–8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again.

During a foraging period, they will stop and dig a "V" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location.  When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue—as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded.  Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly.  It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils.  When successful, the aardvark's long (up to 30 cm ) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin.  After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers.  Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move.  When these insects move, they can form columns 10 - long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark.  These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals.  The trampled grass and dung attract termites from Odontotermes, Microtermes, and Pseudacanthotermes genera.

On a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time (20:00-00:00); however, they don't seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other.  During adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems.  They cover between 2 and per night; however, some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as 30 km in a night.

The aardvark is a rather quiet animal.  However, it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance.  It makes a bleating sound if frightened.  When it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows.  If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly.  This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear.

The aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents.  It can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes, but otherwise moves fairly slowly.

When leaving the burrow at night, they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes, sniffing and listening.  After this period of watchfulness, it will bound out and within seconds it will be 10 m away.  It will then pause, prick its ears, twisting its head to listen, then jump and move off to start foraging.

Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes.  Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main burrow is also used for breeding.  Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as 13 m .  These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter.  The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one.  The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene.  As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the African wild dog, ant-eating chat, "Nycteris thebaica" and warthogs.  Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards.  Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season.  Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature.  If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws.  The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest, which also serves as protection from its predators.

Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a gestation period of seven months, one cub weighing around 1.7 - is born during May–July.  When born, the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles.  When nursing, it will nurse off each teat in succession.  After two weeks, the folds of skin disappear and after three, the ears can be held upright.  After 5–6 weeks, body hair starts growing.  It is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks, is eating termites at 9 weeks, and is weaned between three months and 16 weeks.  At six months of age, it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season, and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age.

Aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers, however, this is possibly due to the fact that they are not readily seen.  There are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits; however, their numbers seem to be stable overall.  They are not considered common anywhere in Africa, but due to their large range, they maintain sufficient numbers.  There may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern, northern, and western Africa.  Southern African numbers are not decreasing.  It receives an official designation from the IUCN as least concern.  However, they are a species in a precarious situation, as they are so dependent on such specific food; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites, the species as a whole would be affected drastically.

Aardvarks handle captivity well.  The first zoo to have one was London Zoo in 1869, which had an animal from South Africa.

In African folklore, the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants.  Hausa magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree.  Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night.  The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission.  Also, some tribes, such as the Margbetu, Ayanda, and Logo, will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets, which are regarded as good luck charms.  The meat, which has a resemblance to pork, is eaten in certain cultures.

The Egyptian god Set is usually depicted with the head of an unidentified animal, whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship.

The titular character of "Arthur", an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by WGBH, shown in more than 180 countries, is an aardvark.

Otis the Aardvark was a puppet character used on Children's BBC programming.

An aardvark features as the antagonist in the cartoon "The Ant and the Aardvark" as well as in the Canadian animated series "The Raccoons".

In the military, the Air Force supersonic fighter-bomber F-111/FB-111 was nicknamed the Aardvark because of its long nose resembling the animal.  It also had similarities with its nocturnal missions flown at a very low level employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground.  In the US Navy, the squadron VF-114 was nicknamed the Aardvarks, flying F-4s and then F-14s.  The squadron mascot was adapted from the animal in the comic strip "B.C.", which the F-4 was said to resemble.

Aardwolf

The aardwolf ("Proteles cristata") is a small, insectivorous mammal, native to East and Southern Africa.  Its name means "earth wolf" in Afrikaans and Dutch.  It is also called "maanhaar jackal" (Afrikaans for "mane jackal") or "civet hyena", based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland, a characteristic shared with the civet.  The aardwolf is in the same family as the hyena.  Unlike many of its relatives in the order Carnivora, the aardwolf does not hunt large animals.  It eats insects, mainly termites – one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night, using its long, sticky tongue to capture them.  The aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern Africa – open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs.  It is nocturnal, resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food.  Its diet consists mainly of termites and insect larvae.

The aardwolf is the only surviving species in the mammalian subfamily Protelinae.  There is disagreement as to whether the species is monotypic.  or can be divided into subspecies "P. c. cristatus" of Southern Africa and "P. c. septentrionalis" of East Africa.  Recent studies have shown that the aardwolf probably broke away from the rest of the hyena family early on; however, how early is still unclear, as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by 10 million years.

The aardwolf is generally classified with the Hyaenidae, though it was formerly placed into the family Protelidae.  Early on, scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the striped hyena, which subsequently led to the creation of Protelidae.

The generic name "proteles" comes from two words both of Greek origin, "protos" and "teleos" which combined means "complete in front" based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear.  The specific name, "cristatus", comes from Latin and means "provided with a comb", relating to their mane.

The aardwolf resembles a very thin striped hyena, but with a more slender muzzle, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back.  It also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore- and hind-quarters, along with several stripes on its legs.  The mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger.  It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have.  Its lower leg (from the knee down) is all black, and its tail is bushy with a black tip.  The aardwolf is about 55 to long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about 20 - long, and stands about 40 to tall at the shoulders.  An adult aardwolf weighs approximately 7 – , sometimes reaching 15 kg .  The aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller (about 10 kg ), whereas the eastern version weighs more (around 14 kg ).  The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena.  The teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas, though smaller, and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects.  It does still have canines, but, unlike other hyenas, these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense.  Its ears, which are large, are very similar to those of the striped hyena.

As an aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats.

Aardwolves live in open, dry plains and bushland, avoiding mountainous areas.  Due to their specific food requirements, they are only found in regions where termites of the family Hodotermitidae occur.  Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs, including farmland.  For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.

There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa.  The species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests.

An adult pair, along with their most recent offspring, occupies a territory of 1 - .

Aardwolves are shy and nocturnal, sleeping in underground burrows by day.  They will, on occasion during the winter, become diurnal feeders.  This happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat.

They have often been mistaken for solitary animals.  In fact, they live as monogamous pairs with their young.  If their territory is infringed upon, they will chase the intruder up to 400 m or to the border.  If the intruder is caught, which rarely happens, a fight will occur, which is accompanied by soft clucking, hoarse barking, and a type of roar.  The majority of incursions occur during mating season, when they can occur once or twice per week.  When food is scarce, the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a "single territory".

The territory is marked by both sexes, as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in 5 mm -long streaks.  Aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad.  They often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so.  If they are patrolling their territorial boundaries, the marking frequency increases drastically, to once every 50 m .  At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour, and upwards of 200 per night.

An aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens, and numerous middens, within their territory.  When they deposit feces at their middens, they dig a small hole and then cover it with sand.  Their dens are usually abandoned aardvark, springhare, or porcupine dens, or on occasion they are crevices in rocks.  They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by springhares.  They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every six months.  During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night, and sleep underground during the heat of the day.

Aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators.  Therefore, when threatened, the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks.  If confronted, it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing.  It also emits a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands.

The aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on "Trinervitermes".  This genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf's range.  In East Africa, they eat "T. bettonianus", and in central Africa, they eat "T. rhodesiensis", and finally in southern Africa, they eat "T. trinervoides".  Their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the aardvark, which digs into the mound.  They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites.  An aardwolf may consume up to 250,000 termites per night using its sticky, long tongue.  They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food.  They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months.  During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter, the primary termites become scarce, so the need for other foods becomes pronounced.  During these times, the southern aardwolf will seek out "Hodotermes mossambicus", a type of harvester termite active in the afternoon, which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter.  The eastern aardwolf, during the rainy season, subsists on termites from the genera "Odontotermes" and "Macrotermes".  They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs, and, some sources say, occasionally small mammals and birds, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet.  Unlike other hyenas, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.  Contrary to popular myths, aardwolves do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass, they are actually eating larvae and beetles.  Also, contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely ground or cooked for them.  The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups, but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers, necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey.  Their primary source, "Trinervitermes", forages in small but dense patches of 25 - .  While foraging, the aardwolf can cover about 1 km per hour, which translates to 8 - per summer night and 3 - per winter night.

The breeding season varies depending on location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring.  In South Africa, breeding occurs in early July.  During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with.  Dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves, which can result in conflict between rival males.  Dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches, they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males' territories.  As the female comes into oestrus, they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories, sometimes doing so more in rivals' territories than their own.  Females will also, when given the opportunity, mate with the dominant male, which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding "his" cubs with her.  Copulation lasts between 1 and 4.5 hours.  Gestation lasts between 89 and 92 days, producing two to five cubs (most often two or three) during the rainy season (November–December), when termites are more active.  They are born with their eyes open, but initially are helpless, and weigh around 200 - .  The first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents.  The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food.  After three months, they begin supervised foraging, and by four months are normally independent, though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season.  By the time the next set of cubs is born, the older cubs have moved on.  Aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at one and a half to two years of age.

The aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and they are relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa.  They are not common throughout their range, as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer, if the food is good.  Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the aardwolf as least concern.  In some areas, they are persecuted by man because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock; however, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental.  In other areas, the farmers have recognized this, but they are still killed, on occasion, for their fur.  Dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the aardwolf.

Aardwolfs are common sights at zoos.  Frankfurt Zoo in Germany was home to the oldest recorded aardwolf in captivity at 18 years and 11 months.

Adobe

Adobe ( , ; ] ) is a building material made from earth and often organic material.  Adobe means mudbrick in Spanish, but in some English speaking regions of Spanish heritage it refers to any kind of earth construction, as most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to cob and rammed earth buildings.  Adobe is among the earliest building materials, and is used throughout the world.

Adobe bricks are most often made into units weighing less than 100 pounds and small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking and be subsequently assembled, with the application of adobe mud, to bond the individual bricks into a structure.  Modern methods of construction allow the pouring of whole adobe walls that are reinforced with steel.

In dry climates, adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world.  Adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater thermal mass, but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not somehow reinforced.  Cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the 1976 Guatemala earthquake, the 2003 Bam earthquake and the 2010 Chile earthquake.

Buildings made of sun-dried earth are common throughout the world (Middle East, Western Asia, North Africa, West Africa, South America, southwestern North America, Spain, and Eastern Europe.)  Adobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the Americas in the Southwestern United States, Mesoamerica, and the Andes for several thousand years.  Puebloan peoples built their adobe structures with handfuls or basketfuls of adobe, until the Spanish introduced them to making bricks.  Adobe bricks were used in Spain from the Late Bronze and Iron Ages (eighth century BCE onwards).  Its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture, and economics.

A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller "adobes", which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger "adobines", some of which may be one to two yards (1–2 m) long.

The word "adobe" has existed for around 4000 years with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning.  The word can be traced from the Middle Egyptian (c. 2000 BC) word "ɟbt" "mudbrick."  Middle Egyptian evolved into Late Egyptian, Demotic or "pre-Coptic", and finally to Coptic (c. 600 BC), where it appeared as τωωβε tōʾpə .  This was borrowed into Arabic as الطوب "aṭ-ṭawbu" or "aṭ-ṭūbu", with the definite article "al-" attached, "tuba", which was assimilated into the Old Spanish language as "adobe" [aˈdobe] , probably via Mozarabic.  English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early 18th century.

In more modern English usage, the term "adobe" has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of North America, especially in New Mexico.

An adobe brick is a composite material made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung.  The soil composition typically contains sand, silt and clay.  Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick.  Dung offers the same advantage.  The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15% clay, 10–30% silt and 55–75% fine sand.  Another source quotes 15–25% clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles 2 to with no deleterious effect.  Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland cement up to 10% by weight.

No more than half the clay content should be expansive clays with the remainder non-expansive illite or kaolinite.  Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick resulting in cracking, while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick.  Typically the soils of the Southwest United States, where such construction is in use, are an adequate composition.

Adobe walls are load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength.  In the United States, most building codes call for a minimum compressive strength of 300 lbf/in (2.07 newton/mm) for the adobe block.  Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads.  The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load.  Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses.  To withstand such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50 lbf/in (0.345 newton/mm) for the finished block.

In addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction.  In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the living space temperature.  The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun (radiation) and from the surrounding air (convection) before they warm through to the interior.  After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will then continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time-lag effect.  Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.

Thermodynamic material properties are sparsely quoted.  The thermal resistance of adobe is quoted as having an R-value of R = 0.41 h ft °F/(Btu in) and a conductivity of 0.57 W/(m K) quoted from another source.  A third source provides the following properties: conductivity=0.30 Btu/(h ft °F); heat capacity=0.24 Btu/(lb °F); density=106 lb/ft (1700 kg/m).  To determine the total R-value of a wall for example, multiply R by the thickness of the wall.  From knowledge of the adobe density, heat capacity and a diffusivity value, the conductivity is found to be k = 0.20 Btu/(h ft °F) or 0.35 W/(m K).  The heat capacity is commonly quoted as c = 0.20 Btu/(lb F) or 840 joules/(kg K).  The density is 95 lb/ft or 1520 kg/m.  The thermal diffusivity is calculated to be 0.0105 ft/h or 2.72x10 m/s.

Poured and puddled adobe (puddled clay, piled earth) today called "cob", is made by placing soft adobe in layers, rather than making by individual dried bricks or using a form.  Puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sand based material worked into a dense, plastic state.  These are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the Americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and then later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.

Bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame.  In North America, the brick is typically about 25 by in size.  The mixture is molded into the frame, which is then is removed after initial setting.  After drying for a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying.  Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.

The same mixture, without straw, is used to make mortar and often plaster on interior and exterior walls.  Some ancient cultures used lime-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.

Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks.  Reinforcement can include manure, straw, cement, rebar or wooden posts.  Experience has shown straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick.  A test is done on the soil content first.  To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid.  The container is shaken vigorously for one minute.  It is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers.  Heavier particles settle out first, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days.  After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined.  Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks.  The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service at New Mexico State University recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.

The ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed, as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall.  Footing depth is to below the ground frost level.  The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively.  Modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall.  Adobe bricks are laid by course.  Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength.  When creating window and door openings, a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above.  Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces.  To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied.  These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically.  Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection.  Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.

The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand and organic materials.  The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe.

Depending on the materials available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks.  Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly.  This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking.

The more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads.  The heaviest wooden beams, called vigas, lie atop the wall.  Across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas and upon those brush is then laid.  Finally, the adobe layer is applied.

To construct a flat adobe roof, beams of wood were laid to span the building, the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls.  Once the vigas, latillas and brush are laid, adobe bricks are placed.  An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof.  Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least 1 in thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick’s edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain.

Depending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof.  The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials.  The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls

The largest structure ever made from adobe is the Arg-é Bam built by the Achaemenid Empire.  Other large adobe structures are the Huaca del Sol in Peru, with 100 million signed bricks and the "ciudellas" of Chan Chan and Tambo Colorado, both in Peru.

Adventure

An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience.  It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.  Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.  The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.

The word adventuress can mean a female who enjoys or partakes in adventures, but (particularly in older literature) it can also have the negative connotation of one who schemes for material advancement by the use her sexuality; a gold digger As an instance of the latter the "Oxford English Dictionary" cites "Our Adventuress had the pickings of a few Feathers from an old Gentleman who fell in Love with her".

Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself.  According to adventurer André Malraux, in his "La Condition Humaine" (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?" .  Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism.  Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren.  Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.

Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's "The Odyssey".

The knight errant was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.

The adventure novel exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as "Star Wars" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark".

Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or Mother Nature.  Examples include books such as Hatchet or My Side of the Mountain.  These books are less about "questing", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.

Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person.  On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles.  Mythologist Joseph Campbell discussed his notion of the monomyth in his book, "The Hero with a Thousand Faces".  Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.

Many video games are adventure games.

From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures.  Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as Marco Polo's journal "The Travels of Marco Polo" or Mark Twain's "Roughing It".  Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of Lewis and Clark or Captain James Cook's journals.  There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe, or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as Conquistadors of the Useless by Lionel Terray.  Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.

There are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement.  Some of these include mountain climbing, skydiving, or other extreme sports.

Asia

Asia ( ) is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres.  It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa.  Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 km2 , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area.  The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations.  Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of /1e9 round 1 billion people, or roughly 60% of the world's population.

In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean.  The western boundary with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them.  The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal, the Ural River, and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas.

China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE.  China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism.  The accidental discovery of America by Columbus in search for India demonstrates this deep fascination.  The Silk Road became the main East-West trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route.  Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen.  Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism (or Daoism), Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastranism, as well as many other religions.

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography.  Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.  It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.

The boundary between Asia and Africa is the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Suez Canal.  This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.

The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.  The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721.  The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the Battle of Poltava in 1709 and assigned to Tobolsk, where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, Vasily Tatishchev, and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia.  The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography.  Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg.  The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary.  Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century.  The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.  The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north.

The border between Asia and the region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Malay Archipelago.  The Maluku Islands in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania.  The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception.  The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European).  Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."

Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the Ancient Greeks, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means.  Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe.  It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.

From the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them.  For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of Asia".

Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass.  Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass - Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal) and share a common continental shelf.  Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate.

The English name "Asia" was originally a concept of Greek civilization.  The place name "Asia" in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience.  Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain.  It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names.  A number of theories have been published.  English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature, where it has the same form, Asia.  Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the Roman Empire is much less certain.  One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.  This metonymical change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as Skandinavia (from Scania).

Before Greek poetry, the Aegean Sea area was in a Greek Dark Age, at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun.  Prior to then in the Bronze Age the records of the Assyrian Empire, the Hittite Empire and the various Mycenaean states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia.  These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the Dorian invasion to this time.  The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called Linear B, deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, Michael Ventris, subsequently assisted by the scholar, John Chadwick.  A major cache discovered by Carl Blegen at the site of ancient Pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals).  They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children.  The epithet, lawiaiai, "captives," associated with some of them identifies their origin.  Some are ethnic names.  One in particular, aswiai, identifies "women of Asia."  Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of Miletus, a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks.  Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.  The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it.  There is a masculine form, aswios.  This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia."  This name, "Assuwa", has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent "Asia".  The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the Hittites under Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE.

Alternatively, the etymology of the term may be from the Akkadian word "(w)aṣû(m)", which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word "asa" meaning east.  This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for "Europe", as being from Akkadian "erēbu(m)" 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

T.R. Reid supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from "asu", meaning 'east' in Assyrian ("ereb" for "Europe" meaning 'west').  The ideas of "Occidental" (form Latin "Occidens" 'setting') and "Oriental" (from Latin "Oriens" for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with "Western" and "Eastern".  Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern civilizations on the Eurasian continent.  Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.

Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word.  Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia.  The Romans named a province Asia, which roughly corresponds with modern-day central-western Turkey.  There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day Iraq.  As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act.  The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as Herodotus, who were all Greek.  Ancient Greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BCE), not because he innovated it, but because his "Histories" are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail.  He defines it carefully, mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing.  By it he means Anatolia and the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt.  Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" (Europa, Asia, and Libya, referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus (i.e. Hesione), but that the Lydians say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis.  In Greek mythology, "Asia" ("Ἀσία") or "Asie" ("Ἀσίη") was the name of a "Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia."

In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels.  The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became "Greek mythology."  For example, Hesiod mentions the daughters of Tethys and Ocean, among whom are a "holy company", "who with the Lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping."  Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia.  Hesiod explains:"For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters."  The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the Luvians in Lydia) in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning "Asian"); and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.

The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes.

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys.  The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities.  These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel.  Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area.  Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes.  The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided.  The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra.  These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts.  The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty.  While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic Caliphate took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the Muslim conquests of the 7th century.  The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe.  Before the Mongol invasion, Song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.

The Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road.

The Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century.  The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards.  In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing Dynasty.  The Islamic Mughal Empire and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.

Asia is the largest continent on Earth.  It covers 8.8% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at 62800 km .  Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia.  It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas.  It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean.  Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, three of them (Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) having part of their land in Europe.

Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features.  Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia.  It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior.  Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia.  The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer.  Southwestern sections of the continent are hot.  Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America.  The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.  The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East.  The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent.  The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world.  Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change.  Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years.  The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change.  Some shifts are already occurring.  For example, in tropical parts of India with a semi-arid climate, the temperature increased by 0.4 °C between 1901 and 2003.

A 2013 study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers.  The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy.

Asia has the second largest nominal GDP of all continents, after Europe, but the largest when measured in purchasing power parity.  As of 2011, the largest economies in Asia are China, Japan, India, South Korea and Indonesia.  Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai.  Around 68 percent of international firms have office in Hong Kong.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of China and India have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%.  Other recent very-high-growth nations in Asia include Israel, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Cyprus and the Philippines, and mineral-rich nations such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.

According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book "The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective", India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE.  China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history, until the British Empire (excluding India) overtook it in the mid-19th century.  For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1986 and Germany in 1968.  (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC).  This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large (current exchange rate method) as that of the rest of Asia combined.  In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$.  Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which have now all received developed country status, having the highest GDP per capita in Asia.

It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2020.  By 2027, according to Goldman Sachs, China will have the largest economy in the world.  Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver.  Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore.  Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads.  Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.

According to Citigroup 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth.  They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.  Asia has four main financial centers: Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai.  Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers.  The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers.  Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.

In 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires.  Last year Asia had toppled Europe.

Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's "economic center of gravity" continued moving east.  At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.

With growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 international visitors.

East Asia had by far the strongest overall Human Development Index (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data.  China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since

1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements.  Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty.  Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.

Nepal, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements.  Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s.  More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.

Japan and South Korea ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the "very high human development" category), followed by Hong Kong (21) and Singapore (27).  Afghanistan (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.

Asia is home to several language families and many language isolates. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken.  For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines.  China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

Many of the world's major religions have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding irreligion), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively.  Asian mythology is complex and diverse.  The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Christians in the Old Testament in the narrative of Noah, is first found in Mesopotamian mythology, in the "Epic of Gilgamesh".  Likewise, the same story of Great Flood is presented to Muslims in the Holy Quran, again in the narrative of Noah, Who according to Islamic mythology was a Prophet and Built an Ark on Allah's Command to save the True Believers from the Great Flood (Great Calamity).  Hindu mythology also tells about an Avatar of the God Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood.  In ancient Chinese mythology, Shan Hai Jing, the Chinese ruler Da Yu, had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess Nüwa who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring.

The Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Bahá'í Faith originated in West Asia.

Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel, the birthplace and historical homeland of the Hebrew nation which today consists equally of those Israelites who remained in Asia/North Africa and those who returned from diaspora in Europe, North America, and other regions, though sizable communities continue to live abroad.  Jews are the predominant ethnic group in Israel (75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million, although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion are unspecified.  Outside of Israel there are small ancient communities of Jewish still live in Turkey (17,400), Azerbaijan (9,100), Iran (8,756), India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000).

Christianity is a widespread religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010, and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014.  Constituting around 12.6% of the total population of Asia.  In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively.  In Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia and Asian Russia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion.  Various Christian denominations have adherents in portions of the Middle East, as well as China and India.  Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.

Islam, which originated in Saudi Arabia, is the largest and most widely spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia.  With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey.  Mecca, Medina and to a lesser extent Jerusalem are the holiest cities for Islam in all the world.  These religious sites attract large numbers of devotees from all over the world, particularly during the Hajj and Umrah seasons.  Iran is the largest Shi'a country.

The Bahá'í Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh.  Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Bahá'í activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities.  Lotus Temple is a big Baha'i Temple in India.

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings.  Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy.  They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, Cārvāka, preached the enjoyment of the material world.  The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia.  In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.

As of 2012, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents.  The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the second largest religion in Asia.  However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia.  Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali, Indonesia.  Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia.  Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (96%), Thailand (95%), Burma (80%–89%), Japan (36%–96%), Bhutan (75%–84%), Sri Lanka (70%), Laos (60%–67%) and Mongolia (53%–93%).  Large Buddhist populations also exist in Singapore (33%–51%), Taiwan (35%–93%), South Korea (23%–50%), Malaysia (19%–21%), Nepal (9%–11%), Vietnam (10%–75%), China (20%–50%), North Korea (1.5%–14%), and small communities in India and Bangladesh.  In many Chinese communities, Mahayana Buddhism is easily syncretized with Taoism, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.  The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.

Jainism is found mainly in India and in oversea Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia.

Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia.

Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations.

Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore.  Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism for many Chinese, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.

Some of the events pivotal in the Asia territory related to the relationship with the outside world in the post-Second World War were:

The polymath Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer from Santiniketan, now in West Bengal, India, became in 1913 the first Asian Nobel laureate.  He won his Nobel Prize in Literature for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on English, French, and other national literatures of Europe and the Americas.  He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.

Other Asian writers who won Nobel Prize for literature include Yasunari Kawabata (Japan, 1968), Kenzaburō Ōe (Japan, 1994), Gao Xingjian (China, 2000), Orhan Pamuk (Turkey, 2006), and Mo Yan (China, 2012).  Some may consider the American writer, Pearl S. Buck, an honorary Asian Nobel laureate, having spent considerable time in China as the daughter of missionaries, and based many of her novels, namely "The Good Earth" (1931) and "The Mother" (1933), as well as the biographies of her parents of their time in China, "The Exile" and "Fighting Angel", all of which earned her the Literature prize in 1938.

Also, Mother Teresa of India and Shirin Ebadi of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children.  Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize.  Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma.  She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma (Myanmar) and a noted prisoner of conscience.  She is a Buddhist and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.  Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China" on 8 October 2010.  He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China.  In 2014, Kailash Satyarthi from India and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize "for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education".

Sir C. V. Raman is the first Asian to get a Nobel prize in Sciences.  He won the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him".

Japan has won the most Nobel Prizes of any Asian nation with 24 followed by India which has won 13.

Amartya Sen, (born 3 November 1933) is an Indian economist who was awarded the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory, and for his interest in the problems of society's poorest members.

Other Asian Nobel Prize winners include Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Abdus Salam, Malala yousafzai, Robert Aumann, Menachem Begin, Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, Daniel Kahneman, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, Ada Yonath, Yasser Arafat, José Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo of Timor Leste, Kim Dae-jung, and 13 Japanese scientists.  Most of the said awardees are from Japan and Israel except for Chandrasekhar and Raman (India), Abdus Salam and Malala yousafzai, (Pakistan), Arafat (Palestinian Territories), Kim (South Korea), and Horta and Belo (Timor Leste).

In 2006, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of Grameen Bank, a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh.  Dr. Yunus received his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States.  He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitute people with little or no collateral to borrow money.  The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.

The Dalai Lama has received approximately eighty-four awards over his spiritual and political career.  On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada.  On 28 May 2005, he received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom.  Most notable was the Nobel Peace Prize, presented in Oslo, Norway on 10 December 1989.

Within the above-mentioned states are several partially recognized countries with limited to no international recognition.  None of them are members of the UN:

Aruba

Aruba ( ; ] ) is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the southern Caribbean Sea, located about 1600 km west of the main part of the Lesser Antilles and 29 km north of the coast of Venezuela.  It measures 32 km long from its northwestern to its southeastern end and 10 km across at its widest point.  Together with Bonaire and Curaçao, Aruba forms a group referred to as the ABC islands.  Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean.

Aruba is one of the four countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands, along with the Netherlands, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten; the citizens of these countries are all Dutch nationals.  Aruba has no administrative subdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions.  Its capital is Oranjestad.

Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape.  This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather.  It has a land area of 179 km2 and is densely populated, with a total of 102,484 inhabitants at the 2010 Census.  It lies outside Hurricane Alley.

Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to have been Caquetío Amerindians from the Arawak tribe, who migrated there from Venezuela to escape attacks by the Caribs.  Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD.  As sea currents made canoe travel to other Caribbean islands difficult, Caquetio culture remained more closely associated with that of mainland South America.

Europeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations for Spain by Amerigo Vespucci and Alonso de Ojeda in the summer of 1499.  Both described Aruba as an "island of giants", remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetíos compared to Europeans.  Gold was not discovered on Aruba for another 300 years.  Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and brazilwood from the island and described houses built into the ocean.  Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and Spaniards soon colonized the island.

Because it had low rainfall, Aruba was not considered profitable for the plantation system and the economics of the slave trade.

Aruba was colonized by Spain for over a century.  "Simas", the "Cacique", or chief, in Aruba, welcomed the first Catholic priests in Aruba, who gave him a wooden cross as a gift.  In 1508, the Spanish Crown appointed Alonso de Ojeda as its first Governor of Aruba, as part of "Nueva Andalucía".  Arawaks spoke the "broken Spanish" which their ancestors had learned on Hispaniola.

Another governor appointed by Spain was Juan Martínez de Ampiés.  A "cédula real" decreed in November 1525 gave Ampiés, factor of Española, the right to repopulate Aruba.  In 1528, Ampiés was replaced by a representative of the House of Welser of Augsburg.

The Dutch statutes have applied to Aruba since 1629.  The Netherlands acquired Aruba in 1636.  Since 1636, Aruba has been under Dutch administration, initially governed by Peter Stuyvesant, later appointed to New Amsterdam (New York City).  Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642.  The island was included under the Dutch West India Company (W.I.C.) administration, as "New Netherland and Curaçao", from 1648 to 1664.  In 1667 the Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as "Commandeur" in Aruba.

The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, leaving the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean.

During the Napoleonic wars, the British Empire took control over the island, between 1799 and 1802, and between 1804 and 1816, before handing it back to the Dutch.

During World War II with the occupation of the Netherlands in 1940 the oil facilities in Aruba came under the administration of the Dutch government-in-exile in London, and Aruba continued to supply oil to the British and their allies.

In August 1947, Aruba presented its first "Staatsreglement" (constitution), for Aruba's "status aparte" as an autonomous state within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  By 1954, the Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.

In 1972, at a conference in Suriname, Betico Croes (MEP), a politician from Aruba, proposed a "sui-generis" Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles, each to have its own nationality.  C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a referendum so that the people of Aruba could choose whether they wanted total independence or "Status Aparte" as a full autonomous state under the Crown.

Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence.  In 1976, he appointed a committee that chose the national flag and anthem, introducing them as symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence.  He set 1981 as a target date for independence.  In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the United Nations; 82% of the participants voted for independence.

The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague to prepare a study for independence; it was titled "Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg" (Aruba and independence, backgrounds, modalities and opportunities; a preliminary report) (1978).  At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.

In March 1983, Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for its independence, to be developed in a series of steps as the Crown granted increasing autonomy.  In August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved.  On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles; it officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  Full independence was projected in 1996.

After his death in 1986, Croes was proclaimed "Libertador di Aruba".  At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's Prime Minister, the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely its transition to full independence.  The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process could be revived after another referendum.

Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the Leeward Antilles island arc of the Lesser Antilles in the southern part of the Caribbean.  It has white sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents.  This is where most tourist development has occurred.  The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.

The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called Hooiberg at 165 m and Mount Jamanota, the highest on the island at 188 m above sea level.  Oranjestad, the capital, is located at .

To the east of Aruba are Bonaire and Curaçao, two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the Netherlands Antilles.  This group of islands is sometimes called the ABC islands.  They are located on the South American continental shelf and therefore geographically listed as part of South America.

The Natural Bridge was a large, naturally formed limestone bridge on the island's north shore.  It was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005.

The island, with a population of just over 100,000 inhabitants, does not have major cities.  However, most of the island's population resides in or surrounding the two major city-like districts of Oranjestad (Capital) and San Nicolaas.  Furthermore, the island is divided into six districts, which are:

The island of Aruba, being isolated from the main land of South America, has fostered the evolution of multiple endemic animals.  The island provides a habitat for the endemic Aruban Whiptail and Aruba Rattlesnake, as well as endemic subspecies of Burrowing Owl and Brown-throated Parakeet.

The rattlesnake and the owl are printed on the Aruban currency.

The flora of Aruba differs from the typical tropical island vegetation.  Xeric scrublands are common, with various forms of cacti, thorny shrubs and evergreens.  The most known plant is the Aloe vera, which has a place on the Coat of Arms of Aruba.

In the Köppen climate classification, Aruba has a tropical semi-arid climate.  Mean monthly temperature in Oranjestad varies little from 26.7 °C to 29.2 C , moderated by constant trade winds from the Atlantic Ocean, which comes from north-east.  Yearly precipitation barely exceeds 470 mm in Oranjestad.

The population is estimated to be 75% mixed European/Amerindian/African, 15% Black and 10% other ethnicities.

The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands.  Although no full-blooded Aboriginals remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic Arawak heritage.  Most of the population is descended from Caquetio Indians and Dutch and to a lesser extent of Africans, Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Sephardic Jewish ancestors.

Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs.  In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting foreign workers to a maximum of three years residency on the island.

Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela.  Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants.  There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.

The official languages are Dutch and Papiamento.  Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba.  It is a creole language, spoken on Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, that incorporates words from Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish.  English is known by many; its usage has grown due to tourism.  Other common languages spoken, based on the size of their community, are Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French.

In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language.  Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento.  The orthography differs per island and even per group of people.  Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. "y" instead of "j"), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.

The book "The Buccaneers of America", first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the natives on Aruba spoke Spanish already.  The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803.  Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.

Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: "Diario", "Bon Dia", "Solo di Pueblo" and "Awe Mainta"; and three in English: "Aruba Daily", "Aruba Today" and "The News".  "Amigoe" is a newspaper published in Dutch.  Aruba also has 18 radio stations (two AM and 16 FM) and two local television stations (Telearuba, and Channel 22).

Three-quarters of the population is Roman Catholic.

For census purposes, Aruba is divided into eight regions, which have no administrative functions:

As a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba's politics take place within a framework of a 21-member Parliament and an eight-member Cabinet.  The governor of Aruba is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or "Parlamento") for four-year terms.  The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.

Together with the Netherlands, the countries of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten form the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport.  As Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration.  To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands.

Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the European Union, though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.

The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model.  In Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with the "Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg" (Court of First Instance) on Aruba, the "Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie van Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten en van Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba" (Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba) and the "Hoge Raad der Nederlanden" (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).  The "Korps Politie Aruba" (Aruba Police Force) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.

Deficit spending has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well.  By 2006, the government's debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.  Aruba received some development aid from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as "Aruba's Financial Independence") in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year.

In 2006, the Aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit.  Direct taxes have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the IMF.  A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%.  The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007.

Aruba's educational system is patterned after the Dutch system of education.

The Government of Aruba finances the public national education system.

There are private schools, including the International School of Aruba and Schakel College.

There are two medical schools, Aureus University School of Medicine and Xavier University School of Medicine, as well as its own national university, the University of Aruba.

Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region.  There is a low unemployment rate.

The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $28,924 in 2014; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas.  Its main trading partners are Colombia, the United States, Venezuela, and the Netherlands.

The island's economy has been dominated by three main industries: tourism, aloe export, and petroleum refining (The Lago Oil and Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.).  Before the "Status Aparte" (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector.  Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal .  The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.

The official exchange rate of the Aruban florin is pegged to the US dollar at 1.79 florins to 1 USD.  Because of this fact, and due to a large number of American tourists, many businesses operate using US dollars instead of florins, especially in the hotel and resort districts.

About three quarters of the Aruban gross national product is earned through tourism or related activities.  Most tourists are from the United States (predominantly from the north-east US), the Netherlands and South America, mainly Venezuela and Colombia.

As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, citizens of the Netherlands can travel with relative ease to Aruba and other islands of the Dutch Antilles.  No visas are needed for Dutch citizens, only a passport, and although the currency used in Aruba is different (the Netherlands uses the Euro), money can be easily exchanged at a local bank for Aruban Florins.

For the facilitation of the passengers whose destination is the United States, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since 1 February 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport.  United States and Aruba have had the agreement since 1986.  It began as a USDA and Customs post.  Since 2008, Aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights.

In 1999, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Forward Operating Location (FOL) at the airport.

On 18 March, Aruba celebrates its National Day.  In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.

Aruba has a varied culture.  According to the "Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister" (BBSB), in 2005 there were ninety-two different nationalities living on the island.  Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of "Sinterklaas" on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 27 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the King's birthday or "Dia di Rey" (Koningsdag) is celebrated.

Christmas and New Year's Eve are celebrated with the typical music and songs for gaitas for Christmas and the Dande for New Year, and "ayaca", "ponche crema", ham, and other typical foods and drinks.  Millions of florins worth of fireworks are burnt at midnight on New Year's Eve.  On 25 January, Betico Croes' birthday is celebrated.  Dia di San Juan is celebrated on 24 June.

Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the Feast of the Ascension and Good Friday are holidays on the island.

The holiday of Carnaval is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like Mardi Gras, that goes on for weeks.  Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from Venezuela and the nearby islands (Curaçao, St. Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery.  Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).

Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as Halloween and Thanksgiving Day in November.

Aruba's Queen Beatrix International Airport is located near Oranjestad.  According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, 61% of whom were Americans.

Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad and Barcadera.  The Port of Playa services all the cruise-ship lines, including Royal Caribbean, Carnival Cruise Lines, NCL, Holland America Line, Disney Cruise Line and others.  Nearly one million tourists enter this port per year.  Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government, runs these seaports.

Arubus is a government-owned bus company.  Its buses operate from 3:30 a.m. until 12:30 a.m., 365 days a year.  Small private vans also provide transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.

A street car service runs on rails on the Mainstreet.

Water-en Energiebedrijf Aruba, N.V. (W.E.B.) produces potable industrial water at the world's third largest desalination plant.  Average daily consumption in Aruba is about 37000 LT .

There are three telecommunications providers: Setar, a government-based company, Mio Wireless and Digicel, both of which are privately owned.  Setar is the provider of services such as internet, video conferencing, GSM wireless technology and land lines.  Digicel is Setar's competitor in wireless technology using the GSM platform, and Mio Wireless provides wireless technology and services using CDMA.

Articles of Confederation

The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was an agreement among the 13 original states of the United States of America that served as its first constitution.  Its drafting by a committee appointed by the Second Continental Congress began on July 12, 1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for ratification on November 15, 1777.  The Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states.  A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states.  The federal government received only those powers which the colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.

The Articles formed a war-time confederation of states, with an extremely limited central government.  While unratified, the document was used by the Congress to conduct business, direct the American Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with foreign nations, and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations.  The adoption of the Articles made few perceptible changes in the federal government, because it did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing.  That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but Americans continued to call it the "Continental Congress", since its organization remained the same.

As the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so.  As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after Shays' Rebellion, individuals began asking for changes to the Articles.  Their hope was to create a stronger national government.  Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems.  However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787.  This became the Constitutional Convention.  It was quickly realized that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced.  On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution.  The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the President), courts, and taxing powers.

The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin's proposed Albany Plan, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems.  The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it.  Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown.  With civil disobedience resulting in coercive, and what the colonials perceived as intolerable acts of Parliament, and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it.  In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government that would run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence.

It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not.  During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority.  It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.

To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it.  In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of "Common Sense" that the “custom of nations” demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain.  The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch.  Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a “manifesto” which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners.  Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, “[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.”

Beyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations.  On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve “to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances” and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states.  Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation.  The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established “a firm league” among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.

On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.  The committee met repeatedly, and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776.  There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures.  The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.

In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777; the final draft of the Articles served as the de facto system of government used by the Congress ("the United States in Congress assembled") until it became de jure by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the Congress of the Confederation.  Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government.  The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government.  It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories.  Article XIII stipulated that "their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state" and "the Union shall be perpetual".

John Dickinson's and Benjamin Franklin's handwritten drafts of the Articles of Confederation are housed at the National Archives in Washington, DC.

The Articles were created by delegates from the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a need to have "a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States."  After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government.  There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base.  The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.

In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the United States Constitution and the new government began operations in 1789.

Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777:

The document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all 13 states.  The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777; the thirteenth state to ratify was Maryland on February 2, 1781.  A ceremonial confirmation of this thirteenth, final ratification took place in the Congress on March 1, 1781, at high noon.  Twelve states had ratified the Articles by February 1779, 14 months into the process.  Maryland, however, refused to go along until the landed states, especially Virginia, had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the Ohio River to the Union.  It would be two years before the Maryland legislature became satisfied that they would follow through, and voted to ratify.  The various states ratified the Articles of Confederation on the following dates:

The Articles of Confederation contain a preamble, thirteen articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.  The preamble declares that the states "agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union."

What follows here summarizes the purpose and content of each of the thirteen articles.

While still at war with Britain, the revolution's leaders were divided between forming a national government with powers either strong and centralized (the "federalists"), or strictly limited (the "anti federalists").  The Continental Congress compromised by dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states.  It empowered Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, but provided no mechanism to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding.  This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, or even food.

The Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it.  Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance.  In September 1783, George Washington complained that Congress was paralyzed.  Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.

The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the Continental Army, and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers.  As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:

George Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government.  The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress.  ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states.  Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.

The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life.  However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor.  No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783–84.  General Henry Knox, who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army.  The army had long been supportive of a strong union.  Knox wrote:

As Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, "As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution."

Once the war had been won, the Continental Army was largely disbanded.  A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks.  Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies.  The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met.  In 1783, George Washington defused the Newburgh conspiracy, but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.

The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states.  Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests.  The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs.  Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis.  This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.

Even after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy.  In 1789, Thomas Jefferson, concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates, wrote to James Monroe, "It will be said there is no money in the treasury.  There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth.  The states must see the rod.”

Furthermore, the Jay–Gardoqui Treaty with Spain in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy.  In this treaty — which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity — the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains.  Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil — forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation.  This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris (1783) was superseded by the implementation of Jay's Treaty in 1795 under the new U.S. Constitution.

Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited.  The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers.  Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.

Congress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states.  The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money.  As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated.  In 1779, George Washington wrote to John Jay, who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, "that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions."  Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the States.  In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were "the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity."  He argued that Americans should avoid having it said "that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent" or that "her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith."  The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.

Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies.  The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War.  Some States paid off their war debts and others did not.  Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.

Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact.  The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use.  This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.

The Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River.  Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the township (36 square miles), the section (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 acres).  This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire).  Then, when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.

The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims, organized the Northwest Territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states.  While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the Ohio River and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, eventually became the states of: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River.  The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery.  New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.

No new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation.  The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the Province of Quebec (referred to as "Canada" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so.  It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission.  Additionally, ordinances to admit Frankland (later modified to Franklin), Kentucky, and Vermont to the Union were considered, but none were approved.

The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure.  The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced.  There was no president and no national court.  Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.

By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity.  However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires.  The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships.  France and Spain established similar policies.  Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again.  Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution.  The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation.  In 1786–87, Shays' Rebellion, an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.

The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression "not worth a continental".  Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States.  Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.

When John Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce.  Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty.  Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain.  Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws.  Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect.  When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.

By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping.  State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit.  Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.

The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor.  Alexander Hamilton realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress.  Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.

The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777.  A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress.  On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of Henry Laurens and Charles Thomson, who were the President and Secretary to the Congress.

The Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank.  Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778.  They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.

On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready.  They dated it, and began to sign.  They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed.  On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified.  New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified.  North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.

After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended.  For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8.  John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.

The other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation.  Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779.  Maryland refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims.

On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis.  As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, "among engrossed Bills" was "signed and sealed by Governor Thomas Sim Lee in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation" and perpetual union among the states.  The Senate then adjourned "to the first Monday in August next."  The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12.  The confirmation signing of the Articles by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781, and was celebrated in the afternoon.  With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.

Congress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years.  Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived.  The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.

The signers and the states they represented were:

Roger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

Robert Morris (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

John Dickinson (Delaware), Daniel Carroll (Maryland) and Gouverneur Morris (New York), along with Sherman and Robert Morris, were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution (Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).

The following list is of those who led the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation as the Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled.  Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions.  He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor President of the United States is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.

"For a full list of Presidents of the Congress Assembled and Presidents under the two Continental Congresses before the Articles, see President of the Continental Congress."

Images of an original draft of the Articles of Confederation stored at the United States National Archive.

On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following James Madison's recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict.  At what came to be known as the Annapolis Convention, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a "Grand Convention."  Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution.  The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed.  The general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships.  Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from "Federalist 39", describes the change this way:

The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun.  Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states.  The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.

In May 1786, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation.  Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries.  Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus.  The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after Shays' Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.

Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of Patrick Henry, George Mason, and other Anti-Federalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:

Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the "consolidated government" proposed by the new Constitution.  They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a "splendid empire" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns.  Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.

Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787.  Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.

Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation.  The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power.  It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island.  Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures "stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace."  The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy.  Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.

When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new "merchant state," much like the British state people had rebelled against.  In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims.  Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.

Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, John Jay of New York and Thomas Burke of North Carolina believed that "the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges."

According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously:

[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.

On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:

The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.

The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.  In 1788, James Madison remarked (in "Federalist No. 40") that the issue had become moot: "As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation."  Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.  At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.  Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.

Modern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus "other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule".  In contrast, law professor Akhil Amar suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.

On July 3, 1788, the Congress received New Hampshire's all-important ninth ratification of the proposed Constitution, thus, according to its terms, establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states.  The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state.  The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that, in light of this development, it would be "unadvisable" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so "under the Articles of Confederation" only, but not "under the Constitution".

By the end of July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.  Congress continued to convene under the Articles with a quorum until October.  On Saturday, September 13, 1788, the Confederation Congress voted the resolve to implement the new Constitution, and on Monday, September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.

On that same September 13, it determined that New York would remain the national capital.

Asia Minor (disambiguation)

Asia Minor is an alternative name for Anatolia, the westernmost protrusion of Asia, comprising the majority of the Republic of Turkey.  It may also refer to:

Atlantic Ocean

The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about 106,460,000 km2 .  It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area.  It separates the "Old World" from the "New World".

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Eurasia and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west.  As one component of the interconnected global ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica).  The Equatorial Counter Current subdivides it into the North Atlantic Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean at about 8°N.

Scientific explorations of the Atlantic include the Challenger expedition, the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.

The oldest known mentions of an "Atlantic" sea come from Stesichorus around mid-sixth century BC (Sch.  A. R. 1.  211): "Atlantikoi pelágei" (Greek: Ἀτλαντικῷ πελάγει; English: 'the Atlantic sea'; etym.  'Sea of Atlantis') and in "The Histories" of Herodotus around 450 BC (Hdt.  1.202.4): "Atlantis thalassa" (Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα; English: 'Sea of Atlantis' or 'the Atlantis sea') where the name refers to "the sea beyond the pillars of Heracles" which is said to be part of the ocean that surrounds all land.  Thus, on one hand, the name refers to Atlas, the Titan in Greek mythology, who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in Medieval maps and also lent his name to modern atlases.  On the other hand, to early Greek sailors and in Ancient Greek mythological literature such as the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey", this all-encompassing ocean was instead known as Oceanus, the gigantic river that encircled the world; in contrast to the enclosed seas well-known to the Greeks: the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

In contrast, the term "Atlantic" originally referred specifically to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and the sea off the Strait of Gibraltar and the North African coast.  The Greek word "thalassa" has been reused by scientists for the huge Panthalassa ocean that surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea hundreds of million years ago.

The term "Aethiopian Ocean", derived from Ancient Ethiopia, was applied to the Southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defined the limits of the oceans and seas in 1953, but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not used by various authorities, institutions, and countries, see for example the CIA World Factbook.  Correspondingly, the extent and number of oceans and seas varies.

The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America.  It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea.  To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are Europe: the Strait of Gibraltar (where it connects with the Mediterranean Sea–one of its marginal seas–and, in turn, the Black Sea, both of which also touch upon Asia) and Africa.

In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean.  The 20° East meridian, running south from Cape Agulhas to Antarctica defines its border.  In the 1953 definition it extends south to Antarctica, while in later maps it is bounded at the 60° parallel by the Southern Ocean.

The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas.  These include the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Labrador Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all of the Scotia Sea, and other tributary water bodies.  Including these marginal seas the coast line of the Atlantic measures 111866 km compared to 135663 km for the Pacific.

Including its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers an area of 106460000 km2 or 23.5% of the global ocean and has a volume of 310410900 km3 or 23.3%.  Excluding its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers 81760000 km2 and has a volume of 305811900 km3 .  The North Atlantic covers 41490000 km2 (11.5%) and the South Atlantic 40270000 km2 (11.1%).  The average depth is 3646 m and the maximum depth, the Milwaukee Deep in the Puerto Rico Trench, is 8486 m .

The bathymetry of the Atlantic is dominated by a submarine mountain range called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR).  It runs from 87°N or 300 km south of the North Pole to the subantarctic Bouvet Island at 42°S.

The MAR divides the Atlantic longitudinally into two halves, in each of which a series of basins are delimited by secondary, transverse ridges.  The MAR reaches above 2000 m along most of its length, but is interrupted by larger transform faults at two places: the Romanche Trench near the Equator and the Gibbs Fracture Zone at 53°N.  The MAR is a barrier for bottom water, but at these two transform faults deep water currents can pass from one side to the other.

The MAR rises 2 - above the surrounding ocean floor and its rift valley is the divergent boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates in the North Atlantic and the South American and African plates in the South Atlantic.  The MAR produces basaltic volcanoes in Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland, and pillow lava on the ocean floor.  The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than 2700 m in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep.

The MAR is intersected by two perpendicular ridges: the Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault, the boundary between the Nubian and Eurasian plates, intersects the MAR at the Azores Triple Junction, on either side of the Azores microplate, near the 40°N.  A much vaguer, nameless boundary, between the North American and South American plates, intersects the MAR near or just north of the Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone, approximately at 16°N.

In the 1870s, the Challenger expedition discovered parts of what is now known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, or:

An elevated ridge rising to an average height of about 1900 fathom below the surface traverses the basins of the North and South Atlantic in a meridianal direction from Cape Farewell, probably its far south at least as Gough Island, following roughly the outlines of the coasts of the Old and the New Worlds.

Most of the MAR runs under water but where it reaches the surfaces it has produced volcanic islands.  While nine of these have collectively been nominated a World Heritage Site for their geological value, four of them are considered of "Outstanding Universal Value" based on their cultural and natural criteria: Þingvellir, Iceland; Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture, Portugal; Gough and Inaccessible Islands, United Kingdom; and Brazilian Atlantic Islands: Fernando de Noronha and Atol das Rocas Reserves, Brazil.

Continental shelves in the Atlantic are wide off Newfoundland, southern-most South America, and north-eastern Europe.

In the western Atlantic carbonate platforms dominate large areas, for example the Blake Plateau and Bermuda Rise.

The Atlantic is surrounded by passive margins except at a few locations where active margins form deep trenches: the Puerto Rico Trench (8414 m maximum depth) in the western Pacific and South Sandwich Trench (8264 m ) in the South Atlantic.  There are numerous submarine canyons off north-eastern North America, western Europe, and north-western Africa.  Some of these canyons extend along the continental rises and farther into the abyssal plains as deep-sea channels.

In 1922 a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred.  The USS Stewart used a Navy Sonic Depth Finder to draw a continuous map across the bed of the Atlantic.  This involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straight forward with pulses being sent from the vessel, which bounce off the ocean floor, then return to the vessel.  The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, abyssal plains, trenches, seamounts, basins, plateaus, canyons, and some guyots. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.

The mean depth between 60°N and 60°S is 3730 m , or close to the average for the global ocean, with a modal depth between 4000 and .

In the South Atlantic the Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise form barriers to ocean currents.

The Laurentian Abyss is found off the eastern coast of Canada.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below -2 C to over 30 C .  Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions.  In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7 – .

From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and Baltic Sea.

The Coriolis effect circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise.  The south tides in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours.  In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation, known as the North Atlantic oscillation, occurs.

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 – 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season.  Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values.  Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter.  Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.

The high surface salinity in the Atlantic, on which the Atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent, is maintained by two processes: the Agulhas Leakage/Rings, which brings salty Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic, and the "Atmospheric Bridge", which evaporates subtropical Atlantic waters and exports it to the Pacific.

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major, upper water masses with distinct temperature and salinity.  The Atlantic Subarctic Upper Water in the northern-most North Atlantic is the source for Subarctic Intermediate Water and North Atlantic Intermediate Water.  North Atlantic Central Water can be divided into the Eastern and Western North Atlantic central Water since the western part is strongly affected by the Gulf Stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water.  The eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to Mediterranean Water.  North Atlantic Central Water flows into South Atlantic Central Water at 15°N.

There are five intermediate waters: four low-salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high-salinity formed through evaporation.  Arctic Intermediate Water, flows from north to become the source for North Atlantic Deep Water south of the Greenland-Scotland sill.  These two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins.  The wide range of salinities in the North Atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources: Labrador Sea, Norwegian-Greenland Sea, Mediterranean, and South Atlantic Intermediate Water.

The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a complex of four water masses, two that form by deep convection in the open ocean — Classical and Upper Labrador Sea Water — and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland sill — Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water.  Along its path across Earth the composition of the NADW is affected by other water masses, especially Antarctic Bottom Water and Mediterranean Overflow Water.

The NADW is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern North Atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in Europe.  Changes in the formation of NADW have been linked to global climate changes in the past.  Since man-made substances were introduced into the environment, the path of the NADW can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from nuclear weapon tests in the 1960s and CFCs.

The clockwise warm-water North Atlantic Gyre occupies the northern Atlantic, and the counter-clockwise warm-water South Atlantic Gyre appears in the southern Atlantic.

In the North Atlantic surface circulation is dominated by three inter-connected currents: the Gulf Stream which flows north-east from the North American coast at Cape Hatteras; the North Atlantic Current, a branch of the Gulf Stream which flows northward from the Grand Banks; and the Subpolar Front, an extension of the North Atlantic Current, a wide, vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre.  This system of currents transport warm water into the North Atlantic, without which temperatures in the North Atlantic and Europe would plunge dramatically.

North of the North Atlantic Gyre, the cyclonic North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre plays a key role in climate variability.  It is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography, rather than being steered by wind, both in the deep ocean and at sea level.

The subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global thermohaline circulation.  Its eastern portion includes eddying branches of the North Atlantic Current which transport warm, saline waters from the subtropics to the north-eastern Atlantic.  There this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of Greenland where they form an intense (40–50 Sv) current which flows around the continental margins of the Labrador Sea.  A third of this water become parts of the deep portion of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW).  The NADW, in its turn, feed the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change.  Large variations in the subpolar gyre on a decade-century scale, associated with the North Atlantic oscillation, are especially pronounced in Labrador Sea Water, the upper layers of the MOC.

The South Atlantic is dominated by the anti-cyclonic southern subtropical gyre.  The South Atlantic Central Water originates in this gyre, while Antarctic Intermediate Water originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region, near the Drake Passage and Falkland Islands.  Both these currents receive some contribution from the Indian Ocean.  On the African east coast the small cyclonic Angola Gyre lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre.

The southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by a wind-induced Ekman layer.  The residence time of the gyre is 4.4–8.5 years.  North Atlantic Deep Water flows southerward below the thermocline of the subtropical gyre.

The Sargasso Sea in the western North Atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of "Sargassum" ("S. fluitans" and "natans") float, an area 4000 km wide and encircled by the Gulf Stream, North Atlantic Drift, and North Equatorial Current.  This population of seaweed probably originated from Tertiary ancestors on the European shores of the former Tethys Ocean and has, if so, maintained itself by vegetative growth, floating in the ocean for millions of years.

Other species endemic to the Sargasso Sea include the sargassum fish, a predator with algae-like appendages who hovers motionless among the "Sargassum".  Fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former Tethys Ocean, in what is now the Carpathian region, that were similar to the Sargasso Sea.  It is possible that the population in the Sargasso Sea migrated to the Atlantic as the Tethys closed at the end of the Miocene around 17 Ma.

The origin of the Sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries.  The fossils found in the Carpathians in the mid-20th century, often called the "quasi-Sargasso assemblage", finally showed that this assemblage originated in the Carpathian Basin from were it migrated over Sicily to the Central Atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the Sargasso Sea.

The location of the spawning ground for European eels remained unknown for decades.  In the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern Sargasso Sea is the spawning ground for both the European and American eel and that the former migrate more than 5000 km and the latter 2000 km .  Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream transport eel larvae from the Sargasso Sea to foraging areas in North America, Europe, and Northern Africa.  Recent but disputed research suggests that eels possibly use Earth's magnetic field to navigate through the ocean both as larvae and as adults.

Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds.  Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates.  Precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.

The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation.  Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator.  The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice.  Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions.  The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.

The Gulf Stream and its northern extension towards Europe, the North Atlantic Drift is thought to have at least some influence on climate.  For example, the Gulf Stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern North America, keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas.  The Gulf Stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the Florida Peninsula.  In the higher latitudes, the North Atlantic Drift, warms the atmosphere over the oceans, keeping the British Isles and north-western Europe mild and cloudy, and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude.  The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the Grand Banks of Newfoundland area) and Africa's north-western coast.  In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas.

Icebergs are common from February to August in the Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as Bermuda and Madeira.  Ships are subject to superstructure icing in the extreme north from October to May.  Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The United States' southeast coast, especially the Virginia and North Carolina coasts, has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs.

The Bermuda Triangle is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but Coast Guard records do not support this belief.

Hurricanes are also a natural hazard in the Atlantic, but mainly in the northern part of the ocean, rarely tropical cyclones form in the southern parts.  Hurricanes usually form annually between June and November.

The break-up of Pangaea began in the Central Atlantic, between North America and Northwest Africa, where rift basins opened during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic.  This period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the Atlas Mountains.  The exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from 200 to 170 Ma.

The opening of the Atlantic Ocean coincided with the initial break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea, both of which were initiated by the eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), one of the most extensive and voluminous large igneous provinces in Earth's history associated with the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event, one of Earth's major extinction events.

Theoliitic dikes, sills, and lava flows from the CAMP eruption at 200 Ma have been found in West Africa, eastern North America, and northern South America.  The extent of the volcanism has been estimated to 4.5e6 km2 of which 2.5e6 km2 covered what is now northern and central Brazil.
