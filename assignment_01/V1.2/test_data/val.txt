Andre Agassi

Andre Kirk Agassi ( ; born April 29, 1970) is an American retired professional tennis player and former World No. 1 who was one of the sport's most dominant players from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s.  Generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Agassi has been called the greatest service returner in the history of the game.  Described by the BBC upon his retirement as "perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport's history", Agassi compiled performances that, along with his unorthodox apparel and attitude, saw him cited as one of the most charismatic players in history.  As a result, he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s.

In singles tennis, Agassi is an eight-time Grand Slam champion and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist, as well as finishing runner-up in seven other Grand Slam tournaments.  During the Open Era, Agassi was the first male player to win four Australian Open titles, a record that was later surpassed by Novak Djokovic when he won his fifth title in 2015, and then by Roger Federer in 2017.  Agassi is one of five male singles players to achieve the Career Grand Slam in the Open Era and one of eight in history, the first of two to achieve the Career Golden Slam (Career Grand Slam and Olympic Gold Medal, the other being Rafael Nadal), and the only man to win the Career Golden Slam and the ATP Tour World Championships (won in 1990): a distinction dubbed as a "Career Super Slam" by "Sports Illustrated".

Agassi was the first male player to win all four Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass), and the last American male to win both the French Open (in 1999) and the Australian Open (in 2003).  He also won 17 ATP Masters Series titles and was part of the winning Davis Cup teams in 1990, 1992 and 1995.  Agassi reached the World No. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to World No. 141 in 1997, prompting many to believe that his career was over.  Agassi returned to World No. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years.  During his 20-plus year tour career, Agassi was known by the nickname "The Punisher".

After suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back, a spondylolisthesis (vertebral displacement) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve, Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the US Open to Benjamin Becker.  He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which has raised over $60 million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada.  In 2001, the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a K-12 public charter school for at-risk children.  He has been married to fellow tennis player Steffi Graf since 2001.

Andre Agassi was born in Las Vegas, Nevada to Emmanuel "Mike" Agassi, a former Olympic boxer from Iran and Elizabeth "Betty" Agassi (née Dudley).  His father stated he is from a mixed Armenian and Assyrian heritage.  One of his ancestors changed his surname from Aghassian to Agassi to avoid persecution.  Andre Agassi's mother, Betty, is a breast cancer survivor.  He has three older siblings – Rita (last wife to Pancho Gonzales), Philip and Tami.

In a passage from the book "Open", Agassi details how his father made him play a match for money with football legend Jim Brown, in 1979, when Agassi was 9 years old.  Brown was at a Vegas tennis club complaining to the owner about a money match that was canceled.  Agassi's father stepped in and told Brown that he could play his son and he would put up his house for the wager.  Brown countered with a $10,000 bet, but after he was warned by the club owner not to take the bet because he would lose and be embarrassed, Brown agreed with Mike Agassi that they would set the amount after he and Andre played two sets.  Brown lost those sets, 3–6, 3–6, declined the 10K wager, and offered to play the third set for $500.  He lost 2–6.

At age 13, Andre was sent to Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Florida.  He was meant to stay for only 3 months because that was all his father could afford.  After thirty minutes of watching Agassi play, Bollettieri called Mike and said: "Take your check back.  He's here for free," claiming that Agassi had more natural talent than anyone else he had seen.  Agassi dropped out of school in the ninth grade.

Agassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at La Quinta, California.  He won his first match against John Austin, but then lost his second match to Mats Wilander.  By the end of 1986, Agassi was ranked world no. 91.  He won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the Sul American Open in Itaparica and ended the year ranked world no. 25.  He won six additional tournaments in 1988 (Memphis, U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, Forest Hills WCT, Stuttgart Outdoor, Volvo International and Livingston Open), and, by December of that year, he had surpassed US$1 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments—the fastest anyone in history had reached that level.  During 1988, he also set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager (a record that stood for 17 years until Rafael Nadal broke it in 2005).  His year-end ranking was world no. 3, behind second-ranked Ivan Lendl and top-ranked Mats Wilander.  Both the Association of Tennis Professionals and "Tennis" magazine named Agassi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988.

In addition to not playing the Australian Open (which later became his best Grand Slam event) for the first eight years of his career, Agassi chose not to play at Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its "predominantly white" dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion.  While still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semifinals in 1989.  He began the 1990s with a series of near-misses.  He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez, which he attributes to worrying about his wig falling off.  He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semifinals.  His opponent in the final was Pete Sampras; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro.  Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets.  The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade.  Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in 8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup, beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final.

In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final, where he faced fellow Bollettieri Academy alumnus Jim Courier.  Courier emerged the victor in a five-set final.  Agassi decided to play at Wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear.  He eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit.  He reached the quarterfinals on that occasion, losing in five sets to David Wheaton.

Agassi's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came at Wimbledon, not at the French Open or the US Open, where he had previously enjoyed success.  In 1992, he defeated Goran Ivanišević in a five-set final.  Along the way, Agassi overcame two former Wimbledon champions: Boris Becker and John McEnroe.  No other baseliner would triumph at Wimbledon until Lleyton Hewitt ten years later.  Agassi was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1992.  Agassi once again played on the United States' Davis Cup winning team in 1992.  It was their second Davis cup title in three years.

In 1993, Agassi won the only doubles title of his career, at the Cincinnati Masters, partnered with Petr Korda.  He missed much of the early part of that year due to injuries.  Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and world no. 1 Pete Sampras in five sets.  Agassi lost in the first round at the US Open to Thomas Enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year.

With new coach Brad Gilbert on board, Agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence.  He started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the French Open and Wimbledon.  Nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the Canadian Open.  His comeback culminated at the 1994 US Open with a five-set fourth-round victory against compatriot Michael Chang.  He then became the first man to capture the US Open as an unseeded player, beating Michael Stich in the final.  Along the way, he beat 5 seeded players.

In 1995, Agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old "image is everything" style.  He competed in the 1995 Australian Open (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating Sampras in a four-set final.  Agassi and Sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on hardcourt, with Agassi winning three.  Agassi won three Masters Series events in 1995 (Cincinnati, Key Biscayne, and the Canadian Open) and seven titles total.  He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, with the last victory being in an intense late night four-set semifinal of the US Open against Boris Becker.  The streak ended the next day when Agassi lost the final to Sampras.

Agassi reached the world no. 1 ranking for the first time in April 1995.  He held that ranking until November, for a total of 30 weeks.  Agassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which allowed Sampras to surpass him and finish ranked no. 1 at the year-ending ranking.  In terms of win/loss record, 1995 was Agassi's best year.  He won 73 matches while losing 9 and was also once again a key player on the United States' Davis Cup winning team—the third and final Davis Cup title of Agassi's career.

1996 was a less successful year for Agassi, as he failed to reach any Grand Slam final.  He suffered two early-round losses at the hands of compatriots Chris Woodruff and Doug Flach at the French Open and Wimbledon, respectively, and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semifinals.  At the time, Agassi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play Boris Becker, whom he would have faced in that final.  The high point for Agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, beating Sergi Bruguera of Spain in the final.  Agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key Biscayne.

1997 was the low point of Agassi's career.  His wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year.  He later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend.  He failed an ATP drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink.  The ATP dropped the failed drug test as a warning.  In his autobiography, Agassi admitted that the letter was a lie.  He quit the drug soon after.  At this time Agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress Brooke Shields and had lost interest in the game.  He won no top-level titles, and his ranking sank to world no. 141 on November 10, 1997, prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sport's premier competitors was over and that he would never again win any significant championships.

In 1998, Agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world's top 50.  After returning to top physical and mental shape, Agassi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter.

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and leapt from world no. 110 to no. 6, the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year.  At Wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to Tommy Haas.  He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne, losing to Marcelo Ríos, who became world no. 1 as a result.  At the year end he was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year for the second time in his career (the first being 10 years earlier in 1988).

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat Andrei Medvedev in a five-set French Open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining Rod Laver, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson and Don Budge—these have since been joined by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic) to win all four Grand Slam singles titles during his career.  Only Laver, Agassi, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have achieved this feat during the open era.  This win also made him the first (of only four, the next being Federer, Nadal and Djokovic respectively) male player in history to have won all four Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts).  Agassi also became the only male player to win the Career Super Slam, consisting of all four Grand Slam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal in singles and a Year-End Championship.

Agassi followed his 1999 French Open victory by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras in straight sets.  He rebounded from his Wimbledon defeat by winning the US Open, beating Todd Martin in five sets (rallying from a two sets to one deficit) in the final.  Overall during the year Agassi won 5 titles including two majors and the ATP Masters Series in Paris, where he beat Marat Safin.  Agassi ended 1999 as the world no. 1, ending Sampras's record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993–98).  This was the only time Agassi ended the year at no. 1.

He began the next year by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Sampras in a five-set semifinal and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in a four-set final.  He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since Rod Laver achieved the Grand Slam in 1969.  At the time, Agassi was also only the fourth player since Laver to be the reigning champion of three of four Grand Slam events, missing only the Wimbledon title. .  2000 also saw Agassi reach the semifinals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wimbledon.  At the inaugural Tennis Masters Cup in Lisbon, Agassi reached the final after defeating Marat Safin in the semifinals to end the Russian's hopes to become the youngest world no. 1 in the history of tennis.  Agassi then lost to Gustavo Kuerten in the final, allowing Kuerten to be crowned year-end world no. 1.

Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over Arnaud Clément.  En route, he beat a cramping Rafter in five sets in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the Aussie's last Australian Open.  At Wimbledon, they met again in the semifinals, where Agassi lost another close match to Rafter, 8–6 in the fifth set.  In the quarterfinals at the US Open, Agassi lost a 3-hour, 33 minute epic match with Sampras, 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–7, with no breaks of serve during the 52-game match.  Despite the setback, Agassi finished 2001 ranked world no. 3, becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 3 in three different decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s).  He also was the oldest player (age 31) to finish in the top three since 32-year-old Connors finished at world no. 2 in 1984.

2002 opened with disappointment for Agassi, as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open, where he was a two-time defending champion.  Agassi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his Key Biscayne title beating then rising Roger Federer in a four-set final.  The last duel between Agassi and Sampras came in the final of the US Open, which Sampras won in four sets and left Sampras with a 20–14 edge in their 34 career meetings.  The match was the last of Sampras's career.  Agassi's US Open finish, along with his Masters Series victories in Key Biscayne, Rome and Madrid, helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end world no. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth (and final) Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat Rainer Schüttler in straight sets in the final.  In March, he won his sixth career and third consecutive Key Biscayne title, in the process surpassing his wife, Steffi Graf, who was a five-time winner of the event.  The final was his 18th straight win in that tournament, which broke the previous record of 17 set by Sampras from 1993–95.  (Agassi's winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to Agustín Calleri.)  With the victory, Agassi became the youngest (19 years old) and oldest (32) winner of the Key Biscayne tournament.

On April 28, 2003, he recaptured the world no. 1 ranking after a quarterfinal victory over Xavier Malisse at the Queen's Club Championships to become the oldest top-ranked male player since the ATP rankings began at 33 years and 13 days.  He had held the world no. 1 ranking for two weeks, when Lleyton Hewitt took it back on May 12, 2003.  Agassi then recaptured the world no. 1 ranking once again on June 16, 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until September 7, 2003.  During his career, Agassi held the world no. 1 ranking for a total of 101 weeks.  Agassi's ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from many events.  He did manage to reach the US Open semifinals, where he lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero and surrendered his world no. 1 ranking to Ferrero.  At the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, Agassi lost in the final to Federer and finished the year ranked world no. 4.  At age 33, he was the oldest player to rank in the top 5 since Connors, at age 35, was world no. 4 in 1987.

In 2004, Agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semifinals of the Australian Open to Marat Safin; the loss ended Agassi's 26-match winning streak at the event, a record that still stands.  He won the Masters series event in Cincinnati to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 ATP Masters Series titles, having already won seven of the nine ATP Masters tournament—all except the tournaments in Monte Carlo and Hamburg.  At 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in Cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), surpassed only by Ken Rosewall, who won the title in 1970 at age 35.  He finished the year ranked world no. 8, the oldest player to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old Connors was world no. 7 in 1988.  Agassi also became only the sixth male player during the open era to reach 800 career wins with his first-round victory over Alex Bogomolov in Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles.

Agassi's 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to Federer at the Australian Open.  Agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments, but had to withdraw from several events due to injury.  He lost to Jarkko Nieminen in the first round of the French Open.  He won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the Rogers Cup, before falling to world no. 2 Rafael Nadal.

Agassi's 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final.  After beating Răzvan Sabău and Ivo Karlović in straight sets and Tomáš Berdych in four sets, Agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final.  The most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over James Blake, where he rallied from two sets down to win 7–6 in the fifth set.  His other five-set victims were Xavier Malisse in the fourth round and Robby Ginepri in the semifinals.  In the final, Agassi faced Federer, who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand Slam title in two years.  Federer defeated Agassi in four sets.  Agassi finished 2005 ranked world no. 7, his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings, which tied Connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year's end.

Agassi had a poor start to 2006.  He was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play.  Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season including the French Open.  This caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time.  Agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a tune-up, and then Wimbledon.  He was defeated in the third round by world no. 2 (and eventual runner-up) Rafael Nadal.  Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match.  At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open.  Agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles to Fernando González of Chile, which resulted in him being unseeded at the US Open.

Agassi had a short, but dramatic, run in his final US Open.  Because of extreme back pain, Agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match.  After a tough four-set win against Andrei Pavel, Agassi faced eighth-seeded Marcos Baghdatis in the second round who had earlier advanced to the 2006 Australian Open final and Wimbledon semifinals.  Agassi won in five tough sets as the younger Baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set.  In his last match, Agassi fell to 112th-ranked big-serving Benjamin Becker of Germany in four sets.  Agassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech.

Agassi earned more than $30 million in prize-money during his career, sixth only to Djokovic, Federer, Nadal, Sampras and Murray to date (October 22, 2015).  He also earned more than $25 million a year through endorsements during his career, fourth in all sports at the time.

Since retiring after the 2006 US Open, Agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity.  On September 5, 2007, he was a surprise guest commentator for the Andy Roddick/Roger Federer US Open quarterfinal.  He played an exhibition match at Wimbledon, teaming with his wife, Steffi Graf, to play with Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters.  He played World Team Tennis for the Philadelphia Freedoms in the summer of 2009.  At the 2009 French Open, Agassi was on hand to present Roger Federer, who completed his Career Grand Slam by winning the tournament and joined Agassi as one of six men to complete the Career Grand Slam, with the trophy.

Also in 2009 Agassi played at the Outback Champions Series event for the first time.  He played the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Tennis Championships at Surprise, Arizona, where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion Todd Martin.  He also announced that he will not be playing the tour on a full-time basis, and played the tournament as a favor to long-time friend Jim Courier.  Agassi returned to the tour renamed for the PowerShares Series in 2011 and participated in a total of seven events while winning two.  Agassi beat Courier in the final of the Staples Champions Cup in Boston and later defeated Sampras at the CTCA Championships at his hometown Las Vegas.

In 2012, Agassi took part in five tournaments, winning three of those.  In November, at first he won BILT Champions Showdown in San Jose, beating John McEnroe in the final.  The following day, he defended his title of the CTCA Championships, while defeating Courier in the decisive match.  In the series season finale, he beat Michael Chang for the Acura Champions Cup.  The series and Agassi came back to action in 2014.  Agassi won both tournaments he participated in.  At the Camden Wealth Advisors Cup's final in Houston, Agassi beat James Blake for a rematch of their 2005 US Open quarterfinal.  He defeated Blake again in Portland to win the title of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America Championships.  In 2015, Agassi took part in just one event of the PowerShares Series, losing to Mark Philippoussis in the final of the Champions Shootout.

In 2009, in Macau Agassi and Sampras met for the first time on court since the 2002 US Open final.  Sampras won the exhibition in three sets.  The rivalry between the former champions headlined sports media again in March 2010 after the two participated in the "Hit for Haiti" charity event organized to raise money for the victims of the earthquake.  Partnered with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, the old rivals began making jokes on each other which ended up with Sampras intentionally striking a serve at Agassi's body.  After the event Agassi admitted that he had crossed the line with his jokes and publicly apologized to Sampras.  Agassi and Sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden in New York in front of 19 000 spectators as Sampras defeated Agassi in two sets.  On March 3, 2014, Agassi and Sampras squared off for an exhibition in London for the annual World Tennis Day.  This time it was Agassi who came out on top in two straight sets.

He returned to the tour in May 2017 in the position of coach to Novak Djokovic for the French Open.

Early in his career, Agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle.  His groundstrokes, return of serve, baseline game, anticipation, and eye–hand coordination were always among the best in the game.  On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner.  His favored groundstroke was his flat, accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but in particular down the line.  His forehand was nearly as strong, in particular his inside-out forehand to the ad court.

Agassi's strength was in dictating play from the back of the court.  While he was growing up, his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way.  When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more.  This change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, Brad Gilbert, in their first year together in 1994.  Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted Agassi's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot.  A signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes.  This would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it.

Agassi was raised on hardcourts, but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of Roland Garros, reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career.  Despite grass being his worst surface, his first major win was at the slick grass of Wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time.  His strongest surface over the course of his career, was indeed hardcourt, where he won six of his eight majors.

Agassi established a limited liability company named Andre Agassi Ventures (formerly named Agassi Enterprises).  Agassi, along with five athlete partners (including Wayne Gretzky, Joe Montana, Shaquille O'Neal, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Monica Seles) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named Official All Star Café in April 1996.  The restaurant closed down in 2001.  In 1999, he paid $1 million for a 10 percent stake in Nevada First Bank and made a $10 million profit when it was sold to Western Alliance Bancorp in 2006.  In 2002, he joined the Tennis Channel to promote the channel to consumers and cable and satellite industry, and made an equity investment in the network.  After meeting chef Michael Mina at one of his restaurants in San Francisco, Agassi partnered with him in 2002 to start Mina Group Inc. and opened 18 concept restaurants in San Francisco, San Jose, Dana Point, Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  Agassi was an equity investor of a group that acquired Golden Nugget Las Vegas and Golden Nugget Laughlin from MGM Mirage for $215 million in 2004.  One year later, the group sold the hotel-casino to Landry's, Inc. for $163 million in cash and $182 million in assumed debt.  In 2007, he sat on the board of Meadows Bank, an independent bank in Nevada.  He has invested in start-up companies backed by Allen & Company.

Agassi and Graf formed a company called Agassi Graf Holdings.  They invested in PURE, a nightclub at Caesars Palace, which opened in 2004, and sold it to Angel Management Group in 2010.  In August 2006, Agassi and Graf developed a joint venture with high-end furniture maker Kreiss Enterprises.  They launched a furniture line called Agassi Graf Collection.  In September, Agassi and Graf, through their company Agassi Graf Development LLC, along with Bayview Financial LP, finalized an agreement to develop a condominium hotel, Fairmont Tamarack, at Tamarack Resort in Donnelly, Idaho.  Due to difficult market conditions and delays, they withdrew from the project in 2009.  The group still owns three small chunks of land.  In September, they collaborated with Steve Case's Exclusive Resorts to co-develop luxury resorts and design Agassi-Graf Tennis and Fitness Centers.

They also invested in online ticket reseller viagogo in 2009 and both serve as board members and advisors of the company.

In October 2012, Village Roadshow and investors including Agassi and Graf announced plans to build new water park called Wet'n'Wild Las Vegas in Las Vegas.  Village Roadshow has a 51% stake in the park while Agassi, Graf, and other private investors hold the remaining 49%.  The park opened in May 2013.

IMG managed Agassi from the time he turned pro in 1986 through January 2000 before switching to SFX Sports Group.  His business manager, lawyer and agent was childhood friend Perry Rogers, but they have been estranged since 2008.  In 2009, he and Graf signed with CAA.

Agassi used Prince Graphite rackets early in his career.  He signed a $7 million endorsement contract with Belgian tennis racquet makers Donnay.  He later switched to Head Ti Radical racket and Head's LiquidMetal Radical racket, having signed a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with Head in 1993.  He renewed his contract in 1999 and in November 2003, he signed a lifetime agreement with Head.  He also endorses Penn tennis balls.  On July 25, 2005, Agassi left Nike after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas.  A major reason for Agassi leaving Nike was because Nike refused to donate to Agassi's charities, and Adidas was more than happy to do so.  On May 13, 2013, Agassi rejoined Nike.

Agassi was sponsored by DuPont, Ebel, Mountain Dew in 1993, Mazda in 1997, Kia Motors in 2002, American Express and Deutsche Bank in 2003.  In 1990, he appeared in a television commercial for Canon Inc., promoting the Canon EOS Rebel camera.  Between 1999 and 2000, he signed a multimillion-dollar, multiyear endorsement deal with Schick and became the worldwide spokesman for the company.  Agassi signed a multiyear contract with Twinlab and promoted the company's nutritional supplements.  In mid-2003, he was named the spokesman of Aramis Life, a fragrance by Aramis and signed a five-year deal with the company.  In March 2004, he signed a ten-year agreement worth $1.5 million a year with 24 Hour Fitness, which will open five Andre Agassi fitness centers by year-end.  Prior to the 2012 Australian Open, Agassi and Australian winemaker Jacobs Creek announced a three-year partnership and created the Open Film Series to "[share] personal stories about the life defining moments that shaped his character on and off the court."  In 2007, watchmaker Longines named Agassi as their brand ambassador.

Agassi and his mother appeared in a Got Milk?  advertisement in 2002.

Agassi has appeared in many advertisements and television commercials with Graf.  They both endorsed Deutsche Telekom in 2002, Genworth Financial and Canon Inc. in 2004, LVMH in 2007, and Nintendo Wii and Wii Fit U and Longines in 2013.

In the early 1990s Agassi dated American entertainer Barbra Streisand.  Writing about the relationship in his 2009 autobiography, he said, "We agree that we're good for each other, and so what if she's twenty-eight years older?  We're sympatico, and the public outcry only adds spice to our connection.  It makes our friendship feel forbidden, taboo – another piece of my overall rebellion.  Dating Barbra Streisand is like wearing Hot Lava."  Agassi was married to Brooke Shields from 1997 to 1999.

He married Steffi Graf on October 22, 2001, at their Las Vegas home after the 1999 French Open, with only their mothers as witnesses.  They have two children: son Jaden Gil (born 2001) and daughter Jaz Elle (born 2003).  Agassi has said that he and Graf are not pushing their children toward becoming tennis players.  The Graf-Agassi family resides in Summerlin, a community in the Las Vegas Valley.  Graf's mother and her brother, Michael Graf, with his four children also live there.

Long-time trainer Gil Reyes has been called one of Agassi's closest friends; some have described him as being a "father figure" to Agassi.  In 2012, Agassi and Reyes introduced their own line of fitness equipment, BILT By Agassi and Reyes.  In December 2008, Agassi's childhood friend and former business manager, Perry Rogers, sued Graf for $50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him.

Agassi's autobiography, "Open: An Autobiography," (written with assistance from J. R. Moehringer), was published in November 2009.  In it, Agassi admitted that he used and tested positive for methamphetamine in 1997.  In response to this revelation, Roger Federer declared himself shocked and disappointed, while Marat Safin argued that Agassi should return his prize money and be stripped of his titles.  In an exclusive interview with CBS, Agassi justified himself and asked for understanding, saying that "It was a period in my life where I needed help."  He also revealed that he had always hated tennis during his career because of the constant pressure it exerted on him.  He also revealed he wore a hairpiece earlier in his career and thought Pete Sampras was "robotic".  The book reached No. 1 on the "New York Times" Best Seller list and received favorable reviews.  It won the Autobiography category of the 2010 British Sports Book Awards.

Agassi has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates.  On September 1, 2010, when he appeared on daily WNYC public radio program "The Brian Lehrer Show," he stated that he is a registered Independent.

Agassi founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association in 1994, which assists Las Vegas' young people.  He was awarded the ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth.  He is regularly cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis.  It has also been claimed that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.

Agassi's charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential.  His Boys & Girls Club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world-class junior tennis team.  It also has a basketball program (the Agassi Stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.

In 2001, Agassi opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area.  He personally donated $35 million to the school.  In 2009, the graduating class had 100 percent graduation rate and expected a 100 percent college acceptance rate.  Among other child-related programs that Agassi supports through his Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation is Clark County's only residential facility for abused and neglected children, Child Haven.  In 1997, Agassi donated funding to Child Haven for a six-room classroom building now named the Agassi Center for Education.  His foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the Andre Agassi Cottage for Medically Fragile Children.  This 20-bed facility opened in December 2001, and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases.

In 2007, along with several other athletes, Agassi founded the charity Athletes for Hope, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and aims to inspire all people to volunteer and support their communities.  He created the Canyon-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund and is now known as the Turner-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund.  The Fund is an investment initiative for social change, focusing on the "nationwide effort to move charters from stopgap buildings into permanent campuses."  It has funded over 30 campuses for high performing charter schools and seeks to provide investors with a healthy return.

In September 2013, the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education formed a partnership with V20 Foods to launch Box Budd!es, a line of kids' healthy snacks.  All proceeds go to the Foundation.

In February 2014, Agassi remodeled the vacant University of Phoenix building as a new school called the Doral Academy West through the Canyon-Agassi Charter School Facilities Fund.  Doral Academy opened in August 2014.  The Fund purchased a 4.6-acre plot in Henderson, Nevada to house the Somerset Academy of Las Vegas, which will relocate from its campus inside a church.

By winning the 1999 French Open, Agassi completed a men's singles Career Grand Slam.  He is the 5th of 8 male players in history (after Budge, Perry, Laver, Emerson and before Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic) to achieve this.

Austroasiatic languages

The Austroasiatic languages, in recent classifications synonymous with Mon–Khmer, are a large language family of continental Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout India, Bangladesh, Nepal and the southern border of China.  The name "Austroasiatic" comes from the Latin words for "South" and "Asia", hence "South Asia".  Of these languages, only Vietnamese, Khmer, and Mon have a long-established recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern national languages (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively).  On the subnational level, Khasi has official status in Meghalaya while Santhali, Ho and Mundari are official languages of Jharkhand.  In Myanmar, the Wa language is the de facto official language of Wa State.  The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.

"Ethnologue" identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages.  These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps Shompen, which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and Munda.  However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and Khasi–Khmuic) while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken.  They appear to be the extant autochthonous languages of Southeast Asia (if Andaman islands are not included), with the neighboring Indo-Aryan, Tai–Kadai, Dravidian, Austronesian, and Sino-Tibetan languages being the result of later migrations.

Regarding word structure, Austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic "sesquisyllabic" pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial, unstressed, reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed, full syllable.  This reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original Proto-Austroasiatic prefixes, such as the causative prefix, ranging from CVC syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants.  As for word formation, most Austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes, many have infixes, but suffixes are almost completely non-existent in most branches except Munda, and a few specialized exceptions in other Austroasiatic branches.  The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast, either between modal (normal) voice and breathy (lax) voice or between modal voice and creaky voice.  Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast.  However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, tonogenesis.  Vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages, whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a more typically Austroasiatic structure.

Much work has been done on the reconstruction of Proto-Mon–Khmer in Harry L. Shorto's "Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary".  Little work has been done on the Munda languages, which are not well documented.  With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.

Paul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:

This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for *ʄ .  *ʄ is better preserved in the Katuic languages, which Sidwell has specialized in.  Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle Mekong, in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.

Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the Mon–Khmer languages of Southeast Asia, Northeast India and the Nicobar Islands, and the Munda languages of East and Central India and parts of Bangladesh, parts of Nepal.  However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.

Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade.  By contrast, the relationships "between" these families within Austroasiatic are debated.  In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accepts traditional "Mon–Khmer" as a valid unit.  However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.

In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of Acehnese in Sumatra (Diffloth), the Chamic languages of Vietnam, and the Land Dayak languages of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).

Diffloth's widely cited original classification, now abandoned by Diffloth himself, is used in "Encyclopædia Britannica" and—except for the breakup of Southern Mon–Khmer—in "Ethnologue."

Peiros is a lexicostatistic classification, based on percentages of shared vocabulary.  This means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact.  Indeed, when Sidwell (2009a) replicated Peiros's study with languages known well enough to account for loans, he did not find the internal (branching) structure below.

Diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades, and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations, though like other classifications the evidence has not been published.  As a schematic, we have:

Or in more detail,

This family tree is consistent with recent studies of migration of Y-Chromosomal haplogroup O2a1-M95.  However, the dates obtained from by Zhivotovsky method DNA studies are several times older than that given by linguists.  The route map of the people with haplogroup O2a1-M95, speaking this language can be seen in this link.  Other geneticists criticise the Zhivotovsky method.

Roger Blench (2009) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on substrate evidence in modern-day languages.

Other languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are:

Paul Sidwell (2009a), in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well-known enough to exclude loan words, finds little evidence for internal branching, though he did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant Munda and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic.  He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence.  Sidwell & Blench (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.  If this would the case, Sidwell & Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward.  Sidwell & Blench (2011) suggest Shompen as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating.  In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central Mekong river valley relatively quickly.

Other than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the ancient Khmer alphabet, Thai alphabet and Lao alphabet.  Vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on Chinese logographic writing.  This has since been supplanted by the Latin alphabet in the 20th century.  The following are examples of past-used alphabets or current alphabets of Austroasiatic languages.

According to Chaubey et al., "Austro-Asiatic speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from Southeast Asia, followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations."  According to Riccio et al. (2011), the Munda people are likely descended from Austroasiatic migrants from southeast Asia.  According to Zhang et al. (2015), Austroasiatic migrations from southeast Asia into India took place after the last Glacial maximum, circa 10,000 years ago.

Afroasiatic languages

Afroasiatic (Afro-Asiatic), also known as Afrasian and traditionally as Hamito-Semitic (Chamito-Semitic), is a large language family of several hundred related languages and dialects.  It comprises about 300 or so living languages and dialects, according to the 2009 Ethnologue estimate.  It includes languages spoken predominantly in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel.

Afroasiatic languages have over 350 million native speakers, the fourth largest number of any language family (after Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan and Niger–Congo).  The phylum has six branches: Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, Egyptian, Omotic and Semitic.

By far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language is Arabic.  It is also the most widely spoken language within the Semitic branch, and includes Modern Standard Arabic and spoken colloquial varieties.  Arabic has around 290 million native speakers, who are concentrated primarily in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and Malta.

Other widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include:

In addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as Ancient Egyptian, Akkadian, Biblical Hebrew, and Old Aramaic.  It is uncertain when or where the original homeland of the Afroasiatic family existed.  Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara, and the Levant.

During the early 1800s, linguists grouped the Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian languages within a "Hamitic" phylum, in acknowledgement of these languages' genetic relation with each other and with those in the Semitic phylum.  The terms "Hamitic" and "Semitic" were etymologically derived from the Book of Genesis, which describes various Biblical tribes descended from Ham and Shem, two sons of Noah.  By the 1860s, the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out.

The scholar Friedrich Müller introduced the name "Hamito-Semitic" for the entire family in his "Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft" (1876).  Maurice Delafosse (1914) later coined the term "Afroasiatic" (often now spelled "Afro-Asiatic").  However, it did not come into general use until Joseph Greenberg (1950) formally proposed its adoption.  In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic spanned the continents of both Africa and Asia.

Individual scholars have also called the family "Erythraean" (Tucker 1966) and "Lisramic" (Hodge 1972).  In lieu of "Hamito-Semitic", the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term "Afrasian", meaning "half African, half Asiatic", in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.

The term "Hamito-Semitic" remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.

The Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches:

Although there is general agreement on these six families, there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study Afroasiatic.  In particular:

In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic.  He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.

In the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships.  In 1844, Theodor Benfey suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter "Ethiopic").  In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.

Friedrich Müller named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his "Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft" ("Outline of Linguistics"), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a "Hamitic" group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group.  It was the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius (1810–1884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical gender system.  This "Hamitic language group" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient Egyptian language, the Berber languages, the Cushitic languages, the Beja language, and the Chadic languages.  Unlike Müller, Lepsius considered that Hausa and Nama were part of the Hamitic group.  These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments.  Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.

In 1912, Carl Meinhof published "Die Sprachen der Hamiten" ("The Languages of the Hamites"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the Fula, Maasai, Bari, Nandi, Sandawe and Hadza languages to the Hamitic group.  Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.  Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that "speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'."  But, in the case of the so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a "fallacious theory of language mixture."  Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub "Nilo-Hamitic" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.

Leo Reinisch (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic.  However, his suggestion found little acceptance.  Marcel Cohen (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct "Hamitic" subgroup, and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.  Finally, Joseph Greenberg's 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of "Hamitic" as a language category by linguists.  Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence.  In dismissing the notion of a separate "Nilo-Hamitic" language category in particular, Greenberg was "returning to a view widely held a half century earlier."  He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.  He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family.  Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.

Greenberg's model was fully developed in his book "The Languages of Africa" (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably Nilo-Saharan.  Following Isaac Schapera and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the Hottentot language as a member of the Central Khoisan languages.  To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian Hadza and Sandawe, though this view remains controversial since some scholars consider these languages to be linguistic isolates.  Despite this, Greenberg's model remains the basis for modern classifications of languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.

Since the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive (monophyletic) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense.  Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.

In 1969, Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name Omotic.  This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.

Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and Robert Hetzron, have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.

"Glottolog" does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge.  It therefore splits off the following groups as small families: South Omotic, Mao, Dizoid, Gonga–Gimojan (North Omotic apart from the preceding), Ongota, Kujarge.

Little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic.  However, Christopher Ehret (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.

Otherwise:

Afroasiatic is one of the four major language families spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book "The Languages of Africa" (1963).  It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.

There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family.  However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made.  The best-known of these are the following:

The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).  Symbols on Gerzean (Naqada II) pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating.  This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic.  However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from Proto-Afroasiatic (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them.  Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely.  They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago).  According to Igor M. Diakonoff (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC.  Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC.  These dates are older than those associated with other proto-languages.

The term Afroasiatic Urheimat ("Urheimat" meaning "original homeland" in German) refers to the hypothetical place where Proto-Afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages.  Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel.  Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the Sahara pump operating over the last 10,000 years.

There is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed.  Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara, and the Levant.

Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:

One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.

According to Ehret (1996), tonal languages appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages.  The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically.

The following are some examples of Afroasiatic cognates, including ten pronouns, three nouns, and three verbs.

There are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic, one by Christopher Ehret, and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova.  The two dictionaries disagree on almost everything.  The following table contains the thirty roots or so (out of thousands) that represent a fragile consensus of present research:

Some of the main sources for Afroasiatic etymologies include:

Andorra

Andorra ( ; ] , ] ), officially the Principality of Andorra (Catalan: "Principat d'Andorra" ), also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra (Catalan: "Principat de les Valls d'Andorra" ), is a sovereign landlocked microstate in Southwestern Europe, located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by Spain and France.  Created under a charter in 988, the present principality was formed in 1278.  It is known as a principality as it is a diarchy headed by two Co-Princesthe Catholic Bishop of Urgell in Spain, and the President of France.

Andorra is the sixth-smallest nation in Europe, having an area of 468 km (181 sq mi) and a population of approximately .  Andorra is the 16th-smallest country in the world by land and 11th-smallest country by population.  Its capital Andorra la Vella is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of 1,023 m above sea level.  The official language is Catalan, although Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.

Andorra's tourism services an estimated 10.2 million visitors annually.  It is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is the official currency.  It has been a member of the United Nations since 1993.  In 2013, the people of Andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at 81 years, according to "The Lancet".

The origin of the word "Andorra" is unknown, although several hypotheses have been formulated.  The oldest derivation of the word "Andorra" is from the Greek historian Polybius ("The Histories" III, 35, 1) who describes the "Andosins", an Iberian Pre-Roman tribe, as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the Carthaginian army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the Punic Wars.  The word "Andosini" or "Andosins" (Ἀνδοσίνους) may derive from the Basque "handia" whose meaning is "big" or "giant".  The Andorran toponymy shows evidence of Basque language in the area.  Another theory suggests that the word "Andorra" may derive from the old word "Anorra" that contains the Basque word "ur" (water).

Another theory suggests that "Andorra" may derive from Arabic "al-durra", meaning "The forest" (الدرة).  When the Moors colonized the Iberian Peninsula, the valleys of the Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest, and other regions and towns, also administered by Muslims, received this designation.

Other theories suggest that the term derives from the Navarro-Aragonese "andurrial", which means "land covered with bushes" or "scrubland".

The folk etymology holds that Charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the Biblical Canaanite valley of "Endor" or "Andor" (where the Midianites had been defeated), a name also bestowed by his heir and son Louis le Debonnaire after defeating the Moors in the "wild valleys of Hell".

"La Balma de la Margineda" found by archaeologists at Sant Julia de Loria were the first temporal settled in 10,000 BC as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees.  The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from Ariege and Segre.

During the Neolithic Age the group of humans moved to the Valley of Madriu (nowaday Natural Parc located in Escaldes-Engordany declared UNESCO World Heritage Site) as a permanent camp in 6640 BC.  The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock and developed a commercial trade with people from the Segre and Occitania.

Other archaeological deposits include the "Tombs of Segudet" (Ordino) and "Feixa del Moro" (Sant Julia de Loria) both dated in 4900–4300 BC as an example of the Urn culture in Andorra.

The model of small settlements begin to evolved as a complex urbanism during the Bronze Age.  Metallurgical items of iron, ancient coins and relicaries can be found in the ancient sanctuaries scattered around the country.

The sanctuary of "Roc de les Bruixes" (Stone of the Witches) is maybe the most important archeological complex of this Age in Andorra, located in the parish of Canillo, about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone murals.

The inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the Iberians and historically located in Andorra as the Iberian tribe "Andosins" or "Andosini" (Ἀνδοσίνους) during the VII and II centuries BC.  Influenced by Aquitanias, Basque and Iberian languages the locals developed some current toponyms.  Early writings and documents relating this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the Greek writer Polybius in his "Histories" during the Punic Wars.

Some of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the "Roc d'Enclar" (part of the early Marca Hispanica), "l'Anxiu" in Les Escaldes and "Roc de L'Oral" in Encamp.

It is known the presence of Roman influence from the II century BC to the V century AD.  The places found with more Roman presence are in "Camp Vermell" (Red Field) in Sant Julia de Loria and in some places in Encamp as well as in the "Roc d'Enclar".  People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of Urgellet (nowaday La Seu d'Urgell) and all across Segre through the "Via Romana Strata Ceretana" (also known as "Strata Confluetana").

After the fall of the Roman Empire Andorra was under the influence of the Visigoths, not directly from the Kingdom of Toledo by distance, but more particular from the Diocese of Urgell.  The Visigoths remained during 200 years in the valleys, a period in which Christianization takes place within the country.  The fall of the Visigoths came from the Muslim Empire and its conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.  Andorra remained away from these invasions by the Franks.

Tradition holds that "Charles the Great" (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the Andorran people, under the command of "Marc Almugaver" and an army of five thousand soldiers, in return for fighting against the Moors near Porté-Puymorens (Cerdanya).

Andorra remained part of the Marca Hispanica of the Frankish Empire being overlordship of the territory the Count of Urgell and eventually by the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell.  Also tradition holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, writing the "Carta de Poblament" or a local municipal charter circa 805.

In 988, Borrell II, Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya.  Since then the Bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has been Co-prince of Andorra.

The first document that mentions "Andorra" as a territory is the "Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell" (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell).  The old document dated from 839 depicts the six old parishes of the Andorran valleys and therefore the administrative division of the country.

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys, asked the Lord of Caboet for help and protection.  In 1095 the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra.  Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya.  Years later their daughter, Ermessenda, married Roger Bernat II, the French Count of Foix.  They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and co-sovereigns of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix as aftermath of the Cathar Crusade.  The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of Aragon, Pere II between the Bishop and the Count, by the signing of the first paréage which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the Bishop of Urgell, in Catalonia.  This gave the principality its territory and political form.

A second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the Count of Foix ordered the construction of a castle in "Roc d'Enclar".  The document was ratified by the noble notary Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà and the construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.

In 1364 the political organization of the country named the figure of the syndic (now spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes making possible the creation of local departments ("comuns", "quarts" and "veïnats").  After being ratified by the Bishop Francesc Tovia and the Count Jean I, the "Consell de la Terra" or Consell General de les Valls (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe.  The syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organized the creation of the Justice Courts ("La Cort de Justicia") in 1433 with the Co-Princes and the collection of taxes like "foc i lloc" (literally "fire and site", a national tax active since then).

Although we can find remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century ("Sant Vicenç d'Enclar" or Església de Santa Coloma), Andorra developed an exquisite Romanesque Art during the 9th and 14th centuries, as much in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the Virgin and Child (being the most important the Our Lady of Meritxell).  Nowadays, the Romanesque buildings that form part of Andorra's cultural heritage stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on Església de Sant Esteve, Sant Joan de Caselles, Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters, Sant Martí de la Cortinada and the medieval bridges of Margineda and Escalls among many others.

While the Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the Catalan language at the end of the 11th century Andorra was influenced by the appearance of that language where it was adopted by proximity and influence even decades before it was expanded by the rest of the Kingdom of Aragon.

The local population based its economy during the Middle Ages in the livestock and agriculture, as well as in furs and weavers.  Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first foundries of iron began to appear in Northern Parishes like Ordino, much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.

In 1601 the Tribunal de Corts (High Court of Justice) was created as a result of Huguenot rebellions from France, Inquisition courts coming from Spain and indigenous witchcraft experienced in the country due to the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.  With the passage of time, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of Navarre.  After Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France, he issued an edict in 1607, that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as Co-Princes of Andorra.  During 1617 communal councils form the "sometent" (popular militia or army) to deal with the rise of "bandolerisme" (brigandage) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition, organization and competences current today .

Andorra continues with the same economic system that it had during the 12th-14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy ("fargues", a system similar to "Farga catalana") and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade.  The fair of Andorra la Vella was ratified by the co-princes in 1371 and 1448 being the most important annual national festival commercially ever since.

The country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers, "Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors", located in Escaldes-Engordany founded in 1604 taking advantage of the thermal waters of the area.  By the time the country constitutes the social system of "prohoms" (wealthy society) and "casalers" (rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition), deriving to the tradition of "pubilla" and "hereu".

Three centuries after its foundation the Consell de la Terra locates its headquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in Casa de la Vall in 1702.  The manor house built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the Busquets family.  Inside the parliament was placed the "Closet of the six keys" ("Armari de les sis claus") representative of each Andorran parish and where the Andorran constitution and other documents and laws were kept later on.

In both Guerra dels Segadors and Guerra de Sucesión Española conflicts, the Andorran people (although with the statement neutral country) supported the Catalans who saw their rights reduced in 1716.  The reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra, with cultural works such as the "Book of Privileges" ("Llibre de Privilegis de 1674"), "Manual Digest" (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the "Polità andorrà" (1763) by Antoni Puig.

After the French Revolution Napoleon I reestablished in 1809 the Co-Principate and deleted the French medieval tithe.  Although in 1812–13, the First French Empire annexed Catalonia during the Peninsular War ("Guerra del francés") and divided it in four départements, with Andorra being made part of the district of Puigcerdà (département of Sègre).  In 1814 a royal decree reestablished the independence and economy of Andorra.

Andorra retained its late medieval institutions and rural culture largely unchanged during this period.  In 1866 the syndic Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit lead the "reformist" group in a Council General of 24 members, elected by suffrage limited to heads of families, replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state.  The New Reform ("Nova Reforma" or "Pla de Reforma") began after being ratified by both Co-Princes and established the basis of the constitution and symbols (such as the tricolor flag) of Andorra.  A new service economy arise as a demand of the inhabitants of the valleys and began to build infrastructures such as hotels, spa resorts, roads and telegraph lines.

The authorities of the Co-Princes ("veguer") banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country by establishing an economic conflict with the demand of the Andorran people.  The conflict led to the so-called "Revolution of 1881" or "Troubles of Andorra", when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic during 8 December 1880 and established the "Provisional Revolutionary Council" led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas, who granted the construction of casinos and spas to foreign companies.  During 7 and 9 June 1881, the loyalists of Canillo and Encamp reconquered the parishes of Ordino and Massana by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in Escaldes-Engordany.  After a day of combat finally the Treaty of the Bridge of Escalls was signed the 10 of June.  The Council was replaced and new elections were made but the economic situation worsened with a divided society: the "Qüestió d'Andorra" (the "Andorran Question" in relation to the Eastern Question).  The struggles continued between pro-bishops, pro-French and nationalists who derived the troubles of Canillo in 1882 and 1885.

Andorra participated in the cultural movement of the Catalan Renaixença.  Between 1882 and 1887 the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexists with the knowledge of the official language, Catalan.  Some romantic authors from both France and Spain reported the awakening of the national consciousness of the country.  Jacint Verdaguer lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and share works related to the Renaixença with Joaquim de Riba, writer and photographer.  Fromental Halévy, for his part, had already premiered in 1848 the opera "Le Val d'Andorre" of great success in Europe, where the national consciousness of the valleys during the Peninsular War was exposed in the romantic work.

Andorra declared war on Imperial Germany during World War I, but did not actually take part in the fighting.  It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1958 as it was not included in the Treaty of Versailles.

In 1933, France occupied Andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections.  On 12 July 1934, adventurer Boris Skossyreff issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself "Boris I, King of Andorra", simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell.  He was arrested by the Spanish authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from Spain.  From 1936 until 1940, a French military detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain.  Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war.  During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and Spain.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France, Spain and Portugal.  In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation.  Its political system was modernised in 1993, when it became a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.

Andorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the President of France and the Catholic Bishop of Urgell (Catalonia, Spain) as Co-Princes.  This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as Prince of Andorra, an elected reigning monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people.  The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy, whereby the Head of Government is the chief executive, and of a pluriform multi-party system.

The current Head of Government is Antoni Martí of the Democrats for Andorra (DA).  Executive power is exercised by the government.  Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council.  The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors.  The Councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.

Half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the Councillors are elected in a single national constituency.  Fifteen days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration.  During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected.  Eight days later, the Council convenes once more.  During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.

Candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors.  The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government.  The Syndic General then notifies the Co-Princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra.  The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws.  Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality.  The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires.  If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved.  Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections.  In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office.  After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.

The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court.  The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-Princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates.  It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.

The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court.  The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General.  The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties.  It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council.  They serve eight-year terms.  The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.

Andorra does not have its own armed forces, although there is a small ceremonial army.  Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain.  However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the "Sometent" (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve.  This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need.  Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).

Andorra has a small army, which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates, but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army.  The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all able-bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the "Sometent".  Being a landlocked country, Andorra has no navy.

Prior to World War I Andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 part-time militiamen.  This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials ("viguiers") appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell.

Despite not being involved in any fighting during the First World War, Andorra was technically the longest combatant, as the country was left out of the Versailles Peace Conference, technically remaining at war with Germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until 24 September 1958 when Andorra officially declared peace with Germany.

In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties.  Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities.

The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931.  Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French National Gendarmerie, with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of René-Jules Baulard.  The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year, with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.  The force consisted of six Corporals, one for each parish (although there are currently seven parishes, there were only six until 1978), plus four junior staff officers to co-ordinate action, and a commander with the rank of major.  It was the responsibility of the six corporals, each in his own parish, to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able-bodied men of the parish.

Today a small, twelve-man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran Army, but all able-bodied men remain technically available for military service, with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm.  The army has not fought for more than 700 years, and its main responsibility is to present the flag of Andorra at official ceremonial functions.  According to Marc Forné Molné, Andorra's military budget is strictly from voluntary donations, and the availability of full-time volunteers.

The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference.  In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers, or non-commissioned officers, because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the "Sometent" to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.

Andorra maintains a small but modern and well-equipped internal police force, with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants.  The principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing, criminal detection, border control, and traffic policing.  There are also small specialist units including police dogs, mountain rescue, and a bomb disposal team.

The "Grup d'Intervenció Policia d'Andorra" (GIPA) is a small special forces unit trained in counter-terrorism, and hostage recovery tasks.  Although it is the closest in style to an active military force, it is part of the Police Corps, and not the army.  As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation, the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties, and at other times to routine policing.

The "Andorran Fire Brigade", with headquarters at Santa Coloma, operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters.  The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans) and four ambulances.

Historically, the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires.  The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943.  Serious fires which lasted for two days in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service, and the "Andorran Fire Brigade" was formed on 21 April 1961.

The fire service maintains full-time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigade's headquarters in Santa Coloma, and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.

Andorra consists of seven parishes:

Due to its location in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at 2942 m , and the average elevation of Andorra is 1996 m .  These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the Gran Valira river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of 840 m ).  Andorra's land area is 468 km2 .

Phytogeographically, Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom.  According to the WWF, the territory of Andorra belongs to the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.

Andorra has an alpine climate and continental climate.  Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer.

Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP.  An estimated 10.2 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts.

One of the main sources of income in Andorra is tourism from ski resorts which total over 175 km of ski ground.  The sport brings in over 7 million visitors and an estimated 340 million euros per year, sustaining 2,000 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs at present .

The banking sector, with its tax haven status, also contributes substantially to the economy (the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19% of GDP).  The financial system comprises five banking groups, one specialised credit entity, 8 investment undertaking management entities, 3 asset management companies and 29 insurance companies, 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality.

Agricultural production is limited—only 2% of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported.  Some tobacco is grown locally.  The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising.  Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.  Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.

Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but enjoys a special relationship with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.  Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the French franc and the Spanish peseta in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro.  Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002.  Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014.

Andorra has traditionally had one of the world's lowest unemployment rates.  In 2009 it stood at 2.9%.

Andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven, with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs.  However, during the European sovereign-debt crisis of the 21st century, its tourist economy suffered a decline, partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in Spain, which undercut Andorran duty-free shopping.  This led to a growth in unemployment.  On 1 January 2012, a business tax of 10% was introduced, followed by a sales tax of 2% a year later, which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter.  On 31 May 2013, it was announced that Andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by the end of June, against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among EU members.  The announcement was made following a meeting in Paris between the Head of Government Antoni Marti and the French President and Prince of Andorra, François Hollande.  Hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of Andorra "bringing its taxation in line with international standards".

The population of Andorra is estimated at ().  The population has grown from 5,000 in 1900.

Two-thirds of residents lack Andorran nationality and do not have the right to vote in communal elections.  Moreover, they are not allowed to be elected as president or to own more than 33% of the capital stock of a privately held company.

The historic and official language is Catalan, a Romance language.  The Andorran government encourages the use of Catalan.  It funds a Commission for Catalan Toponymy in Andorra (Catalan: "la Comissió de Toponímia d'Andorra"), and provides free Catalan classes to assist immigrants.  Andorran television and radio stations use Catalan.

Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic proximity, Spanish, Portuguese and French are also commonly spoken.  Most Andorran residents can speak one or more of these, in addition to Catalan.  English is less commonly spoken among the general population, though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts.  Andorra is one of only four European countries (together with France, Monaco, and Turkey) that have never signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities.

According to the "Observatori Social d'Andorra", the linguistic usage in Andorra is as follows:

The population of Andorra is predominantly (88.2%) Catholic.  Their patron saint is Our Lady of Meritxell.  Though it is not an official state religion, the constitution acknowledges a special relationship with the Catholic Church, offering some special privileges to that group .  Other Christian denominations include the Anglican Church, the Unification Church, the New Apostolic Church, and Jehovah's Witnesses.  The small Muslim community is primarily made up of North African immigrants.  There is a small community of Hindus and Bahá'ís and roughly 100 Jews live in Andorra.  (See History of the Jews in Andorra.)

Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required by law to have full-time education.  Education up to secondary level is provided free of charge by the government.

There are three systems of school—Andorran, French, and Spanish—which use Catalan, French, and Spanish, respectively, as the main language of instruction.  Parents may choose which system their children attend.  All schools are built and maintained by Andorran authorities, but teachers in the French and Spanish schools are paid for the most part by France and Spain.  About 50% of Andorran children attend the French primary schools, and the rest attend Spanish or Andorran schools.

The Universitat d'Andorra (UdA) is the state public university and is the only university in Andorra.  It was established in 1997.  The university provides first-level degrees in nursing, computer science, business administration, and educational sciences, in addition to higher professional education courses.  The only two graduate schools in Andorra are the Nursing School and the School of Computer Science, the latter having a PhD programme.

The geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the University of Andorra from developing a full academic programme, and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies, connected to Spanish and French universities.  The Virtual Studies Centre ("Centre d’Estudis Virtuals") at the University runs approximately twenty different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism, law, Catalan philology, humanities, psychology, political sciences, audiovisual communication, telecommunications engineering, and East Asia studies.  The Centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing-education courses for professionals.

Healthcare in Andorra is provided to all employed persons and their families by the government-run social security system, "Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social" (CASS), which is funded by employer and employee contributions in respect of salaries.  The cost of healthcare is covered by CASS at rates of 75% for out-patient expenses such as medicines and hospital visits, 90% for hospitalisation, and 100% for work-related accidents.  The remainder of the costs may be covered by private health insurance.  Other residents and tourists require full private health insurance.

The main hospital, Meritxell, is in Escaldes-Engordany.  There are also 12 primary health care centres in various locations around the principality.

Until the 20th century, Andorra had very limited transport links to the outside world, and development of the country was affected by its physical isolation.  Even now, the nearest major airports at Toulouse and Barcelona are both three hours' drive from Andorra.

Andorra has a road network of 279 km , of which 76 km is unpaved.  The two main roads out of Andorra la Vella are the CG-1 to the Spanish border, and the CG-2 to the French border via the Envalira Tunnel near El Pas de la Casa.  Bus services cover all metropolitan areas and many rural communities, with services on most major routes running half-hourly or more frequently during peak travel times.  There are frequent long-distance bus services from Andorra to Barcelona and Toulouse, plus a daily tour from the former city.  Bus services are mostly run by private companies, but some local ones are operated by the government.

There are no airports for fixed-wing aircraft within Andorra's borders but there are, however, heliports in La Massana (Camí Heliport), Arinsal and Escaldes-Engordany with commercial helicopter services and an airport located in the neighbouring Spanish comarca of Alt Urgell, 12 km south of the Andorran-Spanish border.  Since July 2015, Andorra–La Seu d'Urgell Airport has operated commercial flights to Madrid and Palma de Mallorca, and is the main hub for Air Andorra and Andorra Airlines.

Nearby airports located in Spain and France provide access to international flights for the principality.  The nearest airports are at Perpignan, France (156 km from Andorra) and Lleida, Spain (160 km from Andorra).  The largest nearby airports are at Toulouse, France (165 km from Andorra) and Barcelona, Spain (215 km from Andorra).  There are hourly bus services from both Barcelona and Toulouse airports to Andorra.

The nearest railway station is L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre 10 km east of Andorra which is on the -gauge line from Latour-de-Carol (25 km ) southeast of Andorra, to Toulouse and on to Paris by the French high-speed trains.  This line is operated by the SNCF.  Latour-de-Carol has a scenic trainline to Villefranche-de-Conflent, as well as the SNCF's gauge line connecting to Perpignan, and the RENFE's -gauge line to Barcelona.  There are also direct Intercités de Nuit trains between L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre and Paris on certain dates.

In Andorra, mobile and fixed telephone and internet services are operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, SOM, also known as Andorra Telecom (STA).  The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.

By the end of 2010, it was planned that every home in the country would have fibre-to-the-home for internet access at a minimum speed of 100 Mbit/s, and the availability was complete in June 2012.

There is only one Andorran television station, "Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra" (RTVA).  "Radio Nacional d’Andorra" operates two radio stations, "Radio Andorra" and "Andorra Música".  There are three national newspapers, "Diari d'Andorra", "El Periòdic d'Andorra", and "Bondia" as well as several local newspapers.  There is also an amateur radio society.  Additional TV and radio stations from Spain and France are available via digital terrestrial television and IPTV.

The official and historic language is Catalan.  Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity.

Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and marratxa, which survive in Sant Julià de Lòria especially.  Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbours, but is especially Catalan in character, especially in the presence of dances such as the sardana.  Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in Andorra la Vella and Saint Anne's dance in Escaldes-Engordany.  Andorra's national holiday is Our Lady of Meritxell Day, 8 September.  American folk artist Malvina Reynolds, intrigued by its defence budget of $4.90, wrote a song "Andorra".  Pete Seeger added verses, and sang "Andorra" on his 1962 album "The Bitter and the Sweet".

Andorra is famous for the practice of Winter Sports.  Popular sports played in Andorra include football, rugby union, basketball and roller hockey.

In roller hockey Andorra usually plays in CERH Euro Cup and in FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup.  In 2011, Andorra was the host country to the 2011 European League Final Eight.

The country is represented in association football by the Andorra national football team.  However, the team has had little success internationally because of Andorra's small population.  Football is ruled in Andorra by the Andorran Football Federation founded in 1994, it organizes the national competitions of association football (Primera Divisió, Copa Constitució and Supercopa) and futsal.  FC Andorra, a club based in Andorra la Vella founded in 1942, compete in the Spanish football league system.

Rugby is a traditional sport in Andorra, mainly influenced by the popularity in southern France.  The Andorra national rugby union team, nicknamed ""Els Isards"", has impressed on the international stage in rugby union and rugby sevens.  VPC Andorra XV is a rugby team based in Andorra la Vella actually playing in the French championship.

Basketball popularity has increased in the country since the 1990s, when the Andorran team BC Andorra played in the top league of Spain (Liga ACB).  After 18 years the club returned to the top league in 2014.

Other sports practised in Andorra include cycling, volleyball, judo, Australian Rules football, handball, swimming, gymnastics, tennis and motorsports.  In 2012, Andorra raised its first national cricket team and played a home match against the Dutch Fellowship of Fairly Odd Places Cricket Club, the first match played in the history of Andorra at an altitude of 1300 m .

Andorra first participated at the Olympic Games in 1976.  The country has also appeared in every Winter Olympic Games since 1976.  Andorra competes in the Games of the Small States of Europe being twice the host country in 1991 and 2005.

As part of the Catalan cultural ambit, Andorra is home to a team of castellers, or Catalan human tower builders.  The , based in the town of Santa Coloma d'Andorra, are recognized by the , the governing body of castells.

Ariadna Tudel Cuberes and Sophie Dusautoir Bertrand earned the bronze medal in the women's team competition at the 2009 European Championship of Ski Mountaineering.  Joan Verdu Sanchez earned a bronze medal in Alpine Skiing at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics.  In 2015, Marc Oliveras earned a silver medal in Alpine Skiing at the 2015 Winter Universiade, while Carmina Pallas earned a silver and a bronze medal in the same competition.

Arithmetic mean

In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean ( , stress on third syllable of "arithmetic"), or simply the mean or average when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection.  The collection is often a set of results of an experiment, or a set of results from a survey.  The term "arithmetic mean" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means, such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean.

In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics, sociology, and history, and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent.  For example, per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.

While the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies, it is not a robust statistic, meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values).  Notably, for skewed distributions, such as the distribution of income for which a few people's incomes are substantially greater than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of "middle", and robust statistics, such as the median, may be a better description of central tendency.

The arithmetic mean (or mean or average) is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency.  In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency.  The arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations.  Symbolically, if we have a data set containing the values formula_1, then the arithmetic mean formula_2 is defined by the formula:

(See summation for an explanation of the summation operator).

For example, let us consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400.  The arithmetic mean is

If the data set is a statistical population (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the population mean.  If the data set is a statistical sample (a subset of the population), we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean.

The arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar, for example as in formula_5 (read formula_6 "bar"), which is the mean of the formula_7 values formula_8.

The arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency.  These include:

The arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median.  The median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than, and no more than half are smaller than, the median.  If elements in the sample data increase arithmetically, when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal.  For example, consider the data sample formula_15.  The average is formula_16, as is the median.  However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as formula_17, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly.  In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4.  In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.

There are applications of this phenomenon in many fields.  For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.

A weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation.  For example, the arithmetic mean of formula_18 and formula_19 is formula_20, or equivalently formula_21.  In contrast, a "weighted" mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as formula_22.  Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are formula_23 and formula_24, the former being twice the latter.  Note that the arithmetic mean (sometimes called the "unweighted average" or "equally weighted average") can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to formula_25 in the above example, and equal to formula_26 in a situation with formula_7 numbers being averaged).

When a population of numbers, and any sample of data from it, could take on any of a continuous range of numbers, instead of for example just integers, then the probability of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values, even if the lengths of both ranges are the same.  In such a case, the set of probabilities can be described using a continuous probability distribution.  The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable, is called the "mean of the probability distribution".  The most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode, are equal to each other.  This property does not hold however, in the cases of a great many probability distributions, such as the lognormal distribution illustrated here.

Particular care must be taken when using cyclic data, such as phases or angles. Naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°.

This is incorrect for two reasons:

In general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range.  A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (viz. , define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2°, not 358°).

American Football Conference

The American Football Conference (AFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States.  This conference and its counterpart, the National Football Conference (NFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL.  Both conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger with the rival American Football League (AFL), with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC, and the remaining thirteen NFL clubs forming the NFC.  A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total 16 clubs per each conference.

Since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the New England Patriots have won nine AFC titles, the most of any team in the conference (and of any team in either conference since the merger), and are its current title holder.

Since 2002, the AFC has 16 teams, organized into four divisions each with four teams: East, North, South and West.

Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:

Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL.  Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season.  The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions.  This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle.  Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC South.  In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.

At the end of each season, the top six teams in the conference proceeds into the playoff.  These teams consist of the four division winners and the top two wild card teams.  The AFC playoffs culminate in the AFC Championship Game with the winner receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy.  The AFC Champion then plays the NFC Champion in the Super Bowl.

Both the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970.  The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the Miami Dolphins in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968) before the merger.  In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL's launch (the Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and the then-Baltimore Colts) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC.  The two AFL divisions AFL East and AFL West were more or less intact, while the Century Division, in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central.

Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16.  When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively.  This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences.  The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment.  The expansion Jacksonville Jaguars joined the AFC in 1995.  There have been five teams that have relocated at least once.  In 1984, the Baltimore Colts relocated to Indianapolis in 1984.  In 1995, the Cleveland Browns had attempted to move to Baltimore, the resulting dispute between Cleveland and the team, led to Modell establishing the Baltimore Ravens with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL.
